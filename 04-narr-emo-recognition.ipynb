       "'\\tI\\'ve known about this group for a while and haven\\'t doing anything as I am still in shock in some ways. My ex-wife went down the path of QANON starting I think now in 2019. I was too late to catch it. I didn\\'t even know what QANON was before summer of 2020. What an evil, horrible and vile think so many people have been caught up in. It took my family and tore it apart.   \\n\\n\\n**By the grace of God**  \\n\\n\\n\\tI am quite conservative. For years I blindly supported conservative talkshow host, never thinking to look further into what they were claiming. I was easy to anger, mocked people that didn\\'t see the world as I did. I remember very clearly when I had a change of heart. I pulled away from the things that got me worked up and focused on my family. My heart changed, my relationship with my children improved greatly, and the relationship with my wife soured.   \\n\\tI was (am still) quite conservative, but the change was that I made my own mind up. WWJD became more than just an acronym, actually applying it to my life, and not just mouthing the words. I found relative peace. This is not to say I never failed, I did, but my stress decreased and I was just a happier and better person. At the same time I was accused of \"Making me the bad guy,\" and \"Not supporting me\" when I disagreed with the ex. There were lines I would not cross, if this made me a bad guy then so be it.   \\n\\tThe thing is, this all happened in the 2017-2018, before COVID was even on the radar and way before I became aware of what QANON was. Looking back I could just as easily gone the other way. When trying to sort things out with the ex, I agreed to read anything she sent me. I will admit that there were a few times I started down the road to acceptance, but then it went one step too far and I would snap out of it. The ex took me step by step, you accept one “fact” (which may actually be true), then it’s easier for you to take one more step down the path. I’m so grateful that I was able to take that step back. When I did I would look at wonder at how many steps I was able to take before saying “NO!”  \\n\\n\\n**They are victims**  \\n\\n\\n\\tI truly believe that most QANONers are victims. It must be horrible to live your life in such fear, to believe that there is such evil around you all the time. Intellectually my heart goes out to them as well as their families that have suffered because of their beliefs. I read somewhere that one of the dangers of QANON is that it is not necessarily only conservatives that get caught up in it. There is certainly a place in QANON for people across the political spectrum. That allows them to say *“So-and-so believes this and they are Democrats, or Libertarians”*   \\n\\tI say most are victims because there are people that I believe should clearly know better. And THEM I blame and hold in the highest contempt. As an American I will defend their right to free speech, but it is hard! Their speech broke my family, and hurt my children, but I still believe they have the right. I also have the right to hate that speech and regard it and the people that espouse it in the deepest contempt.   \\n\\n\\n**Happily remarried, but the there is still pain**    \\n\\n\\n\\tI\\'m now happily remarried, and I cannot express how HAPPY I am with my wife. We share something that perhaps comes with maturity, but it is a revelation and such a stark contrast to where I was before.   \\n\\tThe happiness though does not completely erase the pain. In my mind, the ex did what she did, fine. The pain is seeing my two youngest grow up in a QANON household and through no fault of their own suffering from decisions the QANONer makes. So far the ex and I have kept it cordial. For the time being I think it is the better approach but I’m reaching my limit.   \\n\\n\\n**Some people will never understand and final thoughts**  \\n\\n\\n\\tMy new wife is not American, and does not, and I believe cannot, understand the depth that the QANON cult carries people away (especially in the USA). It’s something so surreal that I feel silly talking about it. But people that understand, really understand. So I guess that is why I finally posted.   \\n\\tThis is a part of my story for what it’s worth. When QANON was in the news the people it affected seemed to be considered little. Now the news has moved on and people are forgetting about the evil cult that is QANON. It’s victims, well they were never given much thought to begin with. I believe the evil QANON started is still out there. I pray that people will eventually move on and look back in bewilderment at all this craziness. In the meantime I take it one day at a time, I am grateful for the blessings, and I try to keep a level head and be an example for the children.   \\n\\tGod bless you all. I understand some of the pain. I know there are worse stories out there than mine. Keep your chin up. You are not alone, even if sometimes it feels that you are. '"

I was relieved to discover this community because I have felt so alone in this struggle. \\n\\nI'm living at home for one more semester of community college before going to university. \\n\\nWithin the past two years that I have moved back in with my parents I have noticed a change in my dad. \\n\\nHe was always my hero. The guy I would rely on for all sorts of advice. We were so similar. \\n\\nHe received an injury that made it harder for him to be active and with that came this uptick in \"research\". My dad was always into politics, conspiracy theories, and other things of that flavor online.  However, he doesn't have the same kind of media literacy that I do, and started reading blog posts for his information.\\n\\nHe never would go to the doctor, but has become an anti-vaccer. He thinks it caused the autism my brother has. \\n\\nHe started spiraling. He is up in the morning, looking at his phone. He watches the x22 report and His Glory every single day. These are glorified infomercials and he has fallen for many of them, buying the things that these evil people promote.\\n\\nThe way those people mix Christianity in with their beliefs of the \"great awakening\" that the \"storm is coming\". I can see so clearly that these people are selling snake oil, but my dad doesn't see it this way.\\n\\nHis ideals haven't always meshed with mine. I'm an artsy type and a woman. I have overheard him say over the phone that women are social and have made this country socialist, \"Look what happened when we let them vote.\" \\n\\nHis wish for me was to get married, have kids (and homeschool them) and be a wife to my future husband. Well, I'm a lesbian (have always known I was from age 9).\\n\\nMy dad will send me emails about the conspiracies. In fact, he sent me a text while I was at work from a woman (last name Barnhardt) who thinks that contraception is killing children who would be born and therefore all contraception is evil. I looked at this website further and saw what makes my stomach twist.

I'm biding my time until this semester concludes and I can leave. I am sad because I know I can never come back home, that it isn't safe for my mental health. \\n\\nI wish there was a way to save my dad from this conspiracy, but unfortunately the times I have tried are met with his cognitive dissonance and the dogma he has adopted so righteously.\\n\\nI will always love my dad, but the cult he is in makes it impossible for me to have a relationship with him.\\n\\nIf you are in a similar situation, please tell me about it so I feel less alone. This whole time I have felt so isolated with this deep loss. It's like watching someone you know get taken away and replaced by a stranger until they are unrecognizable.\\n\\nEdit: a couple other things I want to get off my chest:\\n\\nMy father thinks ANTIFA under disguise were the people who stormed the capital because they have tattoos.\\n\\nHe believes that Trump is the truest President of the United States since Ulysses Grant and not the \"corporation\" of the United States (like Biden is).\\n\\nHe believes there are children being held hostage by the cabal (the thirteen bloodlines and hollywood) and cannibalized/sexually abused.\\n\\nHis beliefs keep getting worse. I'm so tired. I just want my dad back.</td>\n",

Are you keeping a daily journal of what you are hearing (reading) so you have some documentation of these happenings?  Maybe people in the future will want to know.\"  If they sound like they're not going to do it, you could also say, \"Well, I'd like to do it then.  That way we can track events and connect them to previous messages, kind of like Q did when he was still communicating to everyone.\"  (I assume he is still silent pretty much since before Jan 6th, anybody know for sure?)  If Q is all new to you, you could reword as \"as I've heard that Q used to do when....\"\\n\\nSomehow interject that it's important that other outside news streams be used to verify events because 'we' need to know what the rest of the population knows, and then suggest some sites that they won't immediately knock down.  If they totally pooh-pooh checking or watching ANYTHING mainstream in the US, ask them if they would consider foreign news sources that are on YouTube, perhaps WION out of India or Aljazeera (I believe WION is okay and generally Aljazeera is actually good, although it's been a little while since I listened to them).  Anyway, approach it as a way of knowing events from the perspective of those who haven't joined Q yet.  (\"yet\", ha)  They may not do that part, so you should keep a little journal with a summary of major news events, maybe AP or Reuters.  I'm not sure, and if anyone has any ideas of how to 'exclude' Q-related stories when they are not mentioned in a list of major events of the day by regular sources, please join in.  Any input or modification to this idea is welcomed.\\n\\nJust a wild thought.  Wish I'd kept a journal of all the stuff I've seen and heard about this from my sister since 2018.

Our OB (and the CDC) recommended anyone who sees the baby in the first 8 weeks (until she'll get her own vaccines) to get a TDAP vaccine and the most recent flu shot.  My understanding is this is not something new.  I think most people reading this can already see where this is going to go.\\n\\nMy parents and I were already having issues because they keep texting me conspiracy theory garbage.  They have shown zero interest in the pregnancy, yet will frequently send anti-vax, wiki-leak, and Q texts at 2am.  We had to have a potentially dangerous procedure (all went well), and my mother wouldn't even call me to talk with me about it, and yet I get a warning a few days later from both parents that the world is basically going to end.  I ignore them as best I can.  I was already on the verge of cutting off communications completely earlier this week.\\n\\nGiven COVID and baby coming soon, we felt we needed to establish some ground rules and expectations with them.  Since they no longer text or answer my phone calls like normal people, we sent an email.  We took special care to not offend or challenge any of their beliefs.  One request (not demand) is we would like them to get the recommended vaccines.  I get an email back last night essentially saying that if we are going to require the vaccines then they guess they won't be seeing the baby.  She also suggests we not 'blindly follow' what the news is saying about vaccines and viruses.\\n\\nI am thrilled absolutely thrilled about having this baby and becoming a dad, but Q has made it so I do not trust my own parents to make smart decisions around our baby.  I struggle seeing how this doesn't eventually end in my having to cut them off completely.  Q may very well lead to my daughter not having a relationship with her only grandparents (all grandparents on my wife's side have passed away).  Fuck Q and Fuck FB for what it's done to my family.

Pre-2016 he was hippie-conservative - into bikes, western dance, Ren faires, camping, hiking, making stuff, collecting, guns, zombie TV, and libertarian politics. He was loud and a egotist who butted into everything. \\n\\nA classic loud Boomer. Made my 26-13 year old young family feel very unhappy with his ranting about gays, trans, and immigrants. They could hardly stay for holidays.\\n\\nThen from 2016 he went total Q and she followed along. Their senior friend group destabilized as everyone ran off to prep for the apocalypse. And then COVID hit and drove them deeper in.  \\n\\nHe ff'd up so many warehouse jobs shooting off his mouth he decided the city was out to get him. They sold their house by the grandkids and started RV living. And we lost them - wandering TX due to OK being \"too.liberal\" :/ \\n\\nApparently he then lost them multiple jobs in TX due to being a Q asshole and alienating Parks Service admin and guests as a host. \\n\\nMeanwhile, mom, 75 is trying to find a job to make up the difference. She's in great shape, but is into quack and natural cures, thinks big medicine is hiding knowledge because Cayenne pepper is a magic cure, and pretty much everything about magical metals, cures, herbs, salts, and shady treatments for cancer. That's actually nothing new - but it puts her in the cross hairs of Q algorithms. \\n\\nShe tries a job for 2wks and quits if she feels she's not being respected enough. (But unfortunately can't operate computers/phones very well anymore)\\n\\nLong story short - he yeeted her because she wasn't respecting him and correcting him, plus not enough kinky sex. (Remember she's 75, but looks about 55-65, but still.)\\n\\nI'm slowly deprogramming her now since she moved in with me into my new home\\nI ask questions.\\n\\n Just questions and empathize two things \"You are very smart and lived through a lot, why would you still believe something that's been prove untrue after 70 years of experiencing it never being true or happening?\"\\n\\nAnd \\n\\n\"Have you ever seen this happen in reality? Have you ever had someone you know irl tell you it happened right in front of them irl?\"\\n\\nI checked her phone - 100s of open tabs. I removed Fox News and told her the AP was corrupted. I showed her how to use her Drive and Office 365 (which of course her computer subbed her to.)\\n\\nThe worst part - she thought she HAD to give him 50 percent of her tiny savings in a divorce. So she preemptively did that. He spent it on his pepper compound and needed more. So he pretended maybe they get back together.\\n\\nSo she went into reverie. And I pushed it because I told her - if she moved in he could never come here or stay here. And I told her I wasn't comfortable for applying for a job in my center where I would be her direct supervisor. (Just because she tells everyone my personal business. No filter. And outright hates on Black people whom I work with a lot.)\\n\\nAnd so 5 months passed. He nearly killed her once passively - like clearing brush on the coldest day of the year. She started getting chest pains then drove herself 60 miles to the hospital /not wanting him to think she was weak. Hypothermia.  \\n\\nSo final blow - he took her out for a event and later ******* and SA her. And she immediately called me and asked to come.\\n\\nIt didn't have to be this way. But boomer gen has a lot of untreated trauma and mental illness. The constructs of the nuclear couple create fears and shame - from unplanned pregnancy to \"dying alone.\"\\n\\nWhat I said \"You are not dying alone if you live with family. You might not have a man, but it sounds like you don't really want a man, you want a friend or friends. Women in our family usually outlive our men by 25 years or more. So in the end you would be with family.\"\\n\\n(Truth is - if she would have stayed with him she would have ended up caring for him and his death thores from untreated cancer and outlived him while being abused financially and physically while living in a 1 room prepper shack far from medical care.)\\n</td>\n",

Well, all you do is talk about the riots and you agree with them don’t you? - I was kind of shocked because I haven’t talked about politics with him for weeks since he was so verbally abusive in the car. I said.. well, yea. He said then you can’t tell *son* that he can’t talk to you about it. If you can’t take it then you can’t give it. New family rule, no one gets to talk about politics.\\nI got my courage up and said bs. No one can say what another person had to hear or what another person can say but, I’m shaking and have a headache now. \\nI am physically disabled and I count on my family- but, this is the kind of thing that makes me want to say f it. \\nThey get on ifunny and husband sees all these fake news things sent from Facebook friends.

I was relieved to discover this community because I have felt so alone in this struggle. \\n\\nI'm living at home for one more semester of community college before going to university. \\n\\nWithin the past two years that I have moved back in with my parents I have noticed a change in my dad. \\n\\nHe was always my hero. The guy I would rely on for all sorts of advice. We were so similar. \\n\\nHe received an injury that made it harder for him to be active and with that came this uptick in \"research\". My dad was always into politics, conspiracy theories, and other things of that flavor online.  However, he doesn't have the same kind of media literacy that I do, and started reading blog posts for his information.\\n\\nHe never would go to the doctor, but has become an anti-vaccer. He thinks it caused the autism my brother has. \\n\\nHe started spiraling. He is up in the morning, looking at his phone. He watches the x22 report and His Glory every single day. These are glorified infomercials and he has fallen for many of them, buying the things that these evil people promote.\\n\\nThe way those people mix Christianity in with their beliefs of the \"great awakening\" that the \"storm is coming\". I can see so clearly that these people are selling snake oil, but my dad doesn't see it this way.\\n\\nHis ideals haven't always meshed with mine. I'm an artsy type and a woman. I have overheard him say over the phone that women are social and have made this country socialist, \"Look what happened when we let them vote.\" \\n\\nHis wish for me was to get married, have kids (and homeschool them) and be a wife to my future husband. Well, I'm a lesbian (have always known I was from age 9).\\n\\nMy dad will send me emails about the conspiracies. In fact, he sent me a text while I was at work from a woman (last name Barnhardt) who thinks that contraception is killing children who would be born and therefore all contraception is evil. I looked at this website further and saw what makes my stomach twist. LGBT people being called sodomites and equated with pedophiles.\\n\\nI always knew I would never come out to my parents, but this recent event was the final nail on the coffin. I'm biding my time until this semester concludes and I can leave. I am sad because I know I can never come back home, that it isn't safe for my mental health. \\n\\nI wish there was a way to save my dad from this conspiracy, but unfortunately the times I have tried are met with his cognitive dissonance and the dogma he has adopted so righteously.\\n\\nI will always love my dad, but the cult he is in makes it impossible for me to have a relationship with him.\\n\\nIf you are in a similar situation, please tell me about it so I feel less alone. This whole time I have felt so isolated with this deep loss. It's like watching someone you know get taken away and replaced by a stranger until they are unrecognizable.\\n\\nEdit: a couple other things I want to get off my chest:\\n\\nMy father thinks ANTIFA under disguise were the people who stormed the capital because they have tattoos.\\n\\nHe believes that Trump is the truest President of the United States since Ulysses Grant and not the \"corporation\" of the United States (like Biden is).\\n\\nHe believes there are children being held hostage by the cabal (the thirteen bloodlines and hollywood) and cannibalized/sexually abused.\\n\\nHis beliefs keep getting worse. I'm so tired. I just want my dad back.   \n",

For over 50 years I would hear him make comments that the Democrats are messing up this country. He will vote for Trump again. He says he gets information from multiple sources but makes excuses for Trump. When I would ask him about Trump's classified documents he would say that Biden had some too.   \\nI know Romney and Liz Cheney have a book that is out. I think if there was one from General Milley my father maybe more accepting of his side of the story. Anyone have good books that my father can read to open his eyes to the insanity of the Republican party?   \n",

Keep in mind, these people know where I live and know that I am a leftist. \\n\\nGOOD MORNING, ok my friend, (name) ,myself and a couple others are trying to get a chapter started here is SW Pa of Operation Underground Rescue ( O. U. R.) would you please at your convenience go to their website and see what they are amazingly doing, but they need more foot soldiers/warriors( no we will not have lethal weapons- unless you want to,lol). They are daily working to rescue children and adult from the sex trafficking industry that now pulls in more money than drug and porn. Also looke up adrenochrome ( do nit go down the rabbit hole, unless you want to lose yourself to the horror) but just get an idea of what is happening. \\n      Jim Caveziel is staring in a movie , you can probably see a trailer if you google it.\\n       We are going to be getting fundraisers going, would love any support as a stand beside rescuer or a fundraiser attended ALL IS WONDERFUL.   \n",

Are you keeping a daily journal of what you are hearing (reading) so you have some documentation of these happenings?  Maybe people in the future will want to know.\"  If they sound like they're not going to do it, you could also say, \"Well, I'd like to do it then.  That way we can track events and connect them to previous messages, kind of like Q did when he was still communicating to everyone.\"  (I assume he is still silent pretty much since before Jan 6th, anybody know for sure?)  If Q is all new to you, you could reword as \"as I've heard that Q used to do when....\"\\n\\nSomehow interject that it's important that other outside news streams be used to verify events because 'we' need to know what the rest of the population knows, and then suggest some sites that they won't immediately knock down.  If they totally pooh-pooh checking or watching ANYTHING mainstream in the US, ask them if they would consider foreign news sources that are on YouTube, perhaps WION out of India or Aljazeera (I believe WION is okay and generally Aljazeera is actually good, although it's been a little while since I listened to them).  Anyway, approach it as a way of knowing events from the perspective of those who haven't joined Q yet.  (\"yet\", ha)  They may not do that part, so you should keep a little journal with a summary of major news events, maybe AP or Reuters.  I'm not sure, and if anyone has any ideas of how to 'exclude' Q-related stories when they are not mentioned in a list of major events of the day by regular sources, please join in.  Any input or modification to this idea is welcomed.\\n\\nJust a wild thought.  Wish I'd kept a journal of all the stuff I've seen and heard about this from my sister since 2018.  All the expectations and no action... over and over and over.   \n",

I'm depressed?  BIDEN!  I can't afford the medical bills because I broke my ankle?  BIDEN!  Etc.  My aunt and grandmother are the same.  My grandmother is 92 and I used to look up to her so much!!  She was never, ever racist and I was so proud of her for that.  Now, Fox News has her being the most racist person I know and I really hate that these are the last memories I will have of her.\\n\\nMy mother once threatened to never speak to me again because I said I was atheist.  She cried to me saying \"why are white conservative christians always so hated!\"  I never said I hated anyone.   \\n She was going to choose Trumper relatives she NEVER MET over me, then expects me to wipe her ass when she is elderly.  Rand Paul has that job, now.\\n\\nAlso, my family can post how \"mentally ill\" democrat voters are, but the one time I posted a real sexual Biblical verse my family got pissed at me and sent me a Bible in the mail.  They said I shouldn't \"pick and choose\" verses in a book they never read!!  They are just TOO STUPID to see what hypocrites they are.   \n",

We are having a baby soon.  Our OB (and the CDC) recommended anyone who sees the baby in the first 8 weeks (until she'll get her own vaccines) to get a TDAP vaccine and the most recent flu shot.  My understanding is this is not something new.  I think most people reading this can already see where this is going to go.\\n\\nMy parents and I were already having issues because they keep texting me conspiracy theory garbage.  They have shown zero interest in the pregnancy, yet will frequently send anti-vax, wiki-leak, and Q texts at 2am.  We had to have a potentially dangerous procedure (all went well), and my mother wouldn't even call me to talk with me about it, and yet I get a warning a few days later from both parents that the world is basically going to end.  I ignore them as best I can.  I was already on the verge of cutting off communications completely earlier this week.\\n\\nGiven COVID and baby coming soon, we felt we needed to establish some ground rules and expectations with them.  Since they no longer text or answer my phone calls like normal people, we sent an email.  We took special care to not offend or challenge any of their beliefs.  One request (not demand) is we would like them to get the recommended vaccines.  I get an email back last night essentially saying that if we are going to require the vaccines then they guess they won't be seeing the baby.  She also suggests we not 'blindly follow' what the news is saying about vaccines and viruses.\\n\\nI am thrilled absolutely thrilled about having this baby and becoming a dad, but Q has made it so I do not trust my own parents to make smart decisions around our baby.  I struggle seeing how this doesn't eventually end in my having to cut them off completely.  Q may very well lead to my daughter not having a relationship with her only grandparents (all grandparents on my wife's side have passed away).  Fuck Q and Fuck FB for what it's done to my family.  I have never been so sad and really don't know where to go from here.   \n",
       "8729   My mom's been married to this dude (in the Western definition) for 20 years and for the first we were ok. Pre-2016 he was hippie-conservative - into bikes, western dance, Ren faires, camping, hiking, making stuff, collecting, guns, zombie TV, and libertarian politics. He was loud and a egotist who butted into everything. \\n\\nA classic loud Boomer. Made my 26-13 year old young family feel very unhappy with his ranting about gays, trans, and immigrants. They could hardly stay for holidays.\\n\\nThen from 2016 he went total Q and she followed along. Their senior friend group destabilized as everyone ran off to prep for the apocalypse. And then COVID hit and drove them deeper in.  \\n\\nHe ff'd up so many warehouse jobs shooting off his mouth he decided the city was out to get him. They sold their house by the grandkids and started RV living. And we lost them - wandering TX due to OK being \"too.liberal\" :/ \\n\\nApparently he then lost them multiple jobs in TX due to being a Q asshole and alienating Parks Service admin and guests as a host. \\n\\nMeanwhile, mom, 75 is trying to find a job to make up the difference. She's in great shape, but is into quack and natural cures, thinks big medicine is hiding knowledge because Cayenne pepper is a magic cure, and pretty much everything about magical metals, cures, herbs, salts, and shady treatments for cancer. That's actually nothing new - but it puts her in the cross hairs of Q algorithms. \\n\\nShe tries a job for 2wks and quits if she feels she's not being respected enough. (But unfortunately can't operate computers/phones very well anymore)\\n\\nLong story short - he yeeted her because she wasn't respecting him and correcting him, plus not enough kinky sex. (Remember she's 75, but looks about 55-65, but still.)\\n\\nI'm slowly deprogramming her now since she moved in with me into my new home\\nI ask questions.\\n\\n Just questions and empathize two things \"You are very smart and lived through a lot, why would you still believe something that's been prove untrue after 70 years of experiencing it never being true or happening?\"\\n\\nAnd \\n\\n\"Have you ever seen this happen in reality? Have you ever had someone you know irl tell you it happened right in front of them irl?\"\\n\\nI checked her phone - 100s of open tabs. I removed Fox News and told her the AP was corrupted. I showed her how to use her Drive and Office 365 (which of course her computer subbed her to.)\\n\\nThe worst part - she thought she HAD to give him 50 percent of her tiny savings in a divorce. So she preemptively did that. He spent it on his pepper compound and needed more. So he pretended maybe they get back together.\\n\\nSo she went into reverie. And I pushed it because I told her - if she moved in he could never come here or stay here. And I told her I wasn't comfortable for applying for a job in my center where I would be her direct supervisor. (Just because she tells everyone my personal business. No filter. And outright hates on Black people whom I work with a lot.)\\n\\nAnd so 5 months passed. He nearly killed her once passively - like clearing brush on the coldest day of the year. She started getting chest pains then drove herself 60 miles to the hospital /not wanting him to think she was weak. Hypothermia.  \\n\\nSo final blow - he took her out for a event and later ******* and SA her. And she immediately called me and asked to come.\\n\\nIt didn't have to be this way. But boomer gen has a lot of untreated trauma and mental illness. The constructs of the nuclear couple create fears and shame - from unplanned pregnancy to \"dying alone.\"\\n\\nWhat I said \"You are not dying alone if you live with family. You might not have a man, but it sounds like you don't really want a man, you want a friend or friends. Women in our family usually outlive our men by 25 years or more. So in the end you would be with family.\"\\n\\n(Truth is - if she would have stayed with him she would have ended up caring for him and his death thores from untreated cancer and outlived him while being abused financially and physically while living in a 1 room prepper shack far from medical care.)\\n   \n",

Nowadays also crossing with Q who are present in Germany as well. He is alarmist, promising the world to collapse evey other day.\\n\\n2 weeks ago, I broke my silence to inform him that his father / my grandfather died. I was always afraid of this moment. Would he try to come back? How deep would he still be into it? Turns out: very deep. Today, he sent me an email that sounds just like - and more extreme - than 10yrs ago. I'm now in my 30s, he is in his 50s. I have no idea how this will end. \\n\\nMy heart goes out to everyone, who is now living through these experiences. \\n\\nIf I learned one thing over the years: take care of yourself, try to work this out - don't surppress that you're hurt. Talk to friends, look for a therapist or helplines focussing on addiction/cults. You are not alone with it and it's not shameful.\\n\\nAnd if you're someones daughter or son: This is mental abuse. It's not your fault. Try to live your life instead and become the person you want to be.\\n\\nIt won't stop hurting, but it will hurt less.   \n",

Bear with me. ( please)\\nSo a few weeks ago I was riding with husband on a nice day -just basically hanging out and doing errands together. I had an opinion he didn’t agree with so he started berating me. It got to the point where I started crying. He pointed in my face and said don’t you dare cry.  (I hardly ever cry)\\nLast night I told my 20 year old son I didn’t want to argue with him. It was about Derek chauvin, riots etc. (he’s got in with some far right wing people on I funny and has become verbally aggressive and unbearable)\\nSo this late morning I am sitting in living room with husband - all of a sudden he says you know how you told *son* that you didn’t want to hear his opinions? Well, all you do is talk about the riots and you agree with them don’t you? - I was kind of shocked because I haven’t talked about politics with him for weeks since he was so verbally abusive in the car. I said.. well, yea. He said then you can’t tell *son* that he can’t talk to you about it. If you can’t take it then you can’t give it. New family rule, no one gets to talk about politics.\\nI got my courage up and said bs. No one can say what another person had to hear or what another person can say but, I’m shaking and have a headache now. \\nI am physically disabled and I count on my family- but, this is the kind of thing that makes me want to say f it. \\nThey get on ifunny and husband sees all these fake news things sent from Facebook friends. Suddenly I’m the enemy. Believe in so much nonsense and are willing to hate me because I won’t. I took care of these people my whole adult life. But, I refuse to spend the rest of my life being treated like an enemy and like garbage. Because I’m not 100 pro gun, don’t believe dems are trying to destroy America, don’t believe that fricking Derek chauvin is right in what he did. I’m just tired of being attacked.

I want to convince them that our shared Qperson is in danger of being taken advantage of by other Qult members and grifters, not to mention the potential for mental breakdown if/when they see their reality start to crack up. \\n\\nMost normies in my family react when I raise alarm by saying it's probably just silly nonsense that will blow over after Biden gets in office. I hope they're right, but I just want them to understand the potential gravity of this. I don't think they would respond to the QAA guys and their long form episodes. They need to be bluepilled with something more concise and not so overtly leftist.\\n\\n(side note: much love to my QAA boys, keep it up. Especially the walking tragedy that is Jake Rockatansky)   \n",

       "      <td>Hey guys. I was relieved to discover this community because I have felt so alone in this struggle. \\n\\nI'm living at home for one more semester of community college before going to university. \\n\\nWithin the past two years that I have moved back in with my parents I have noticed a change in my dad. \\n\\nHe was always my hero. The guy I would rely on for all sorts of advice. We were so similar. \\n\\nHe received an injury that made it harder for him to be active and with that came this uptick in \"research\". My dad was always into politics, conspiracy theories, and other things of that flavor online.  However, he doesn't have the same kind of media literacy that I do, and started reading blog posts for his information.\\n\\nHe never would go to the doctor, but has become an anti-vaccer. He thinks it caused the autism my brother has. \\n\\nHe started spiraling. He is up in the morning, looking at his phone. He watches the x22 report and His Glory every single day. These are glorified infomercials and he has fallen for many of them, buying the things that these evil people promote.\\n\\nThe way those people mix Christianity in with their beliefs of the \"great awakening\" that the \"storm is coming\". I can see so clearly that these people are selling snake oil, but my dad doesn't see it this way.\\n\\nHis ideals haven't always meshed with mine. I'm an artsy type and a woman. I have overheard him say over the phone that women are social and have made this country socialist, \"Look what happened when we let them vote.\" \\n\\nHis wish for me was to get married, have kids (and homeschool them) and be a wife to my future husband. Well, I'm a lesbian (have always known I was from age 9).\\n\\nMy dad will send me emails about the conspiracies. In fact, he sent me a text while I was at work from a woman (last name Barnhardt) who thinks that contraception is killing children who would be born and therefore all contraception is evil. I looked at this website further and saw what makes my stomach twist. LGBT people being called sodomites and equated with pedophiles.\\n\\nI always knew I would never come out to my parents, but this recent event was the final nail on the coffin. I'm biding my time until this semester concludes and I can leave. I am sad because I know I can never come back home, that it isn't safe for my mental health. \\n\\nI wish there was a way to save my dad from this conspiracy, but unfortunately the times I have tried are met with his cognitive dissonance and the dogma he has adopted so righteously.\\n\\nI will always love my dad, but the cult he is in makes it impossible for me to have a relationship with him.\\n\\nIf you are in a similar situation, please tell me about it so I feel less alone. This whole time I have felt so isolated with this deep loss. It's like watching someone you know get taken away and replaced by a stranger until they are unrecognizable.\\n\\nEdit: a couple other things I want to get off my chest:\\n\\nMy father thinks ANTIFA under disguise were the people who stormed the capital because they have tattoos.\\n\\nHe believes that Trump is the truest President of the United States since Ulysses Grant and not the \"corporation\" of the United States (like Biden is).\\n\\nHe believes there are children being held hostage by the cabal (the thirteen bloodlines and hollywood) and cannibalized/sexually abused.\\n\\nHis beliefs keep getting worse. I'm so tired. I just want my dad back.</td>\n",

He says he gets information from multiple sources but makes excuses for Trump. When I would ask him about Trump's classified documents he would say that Biden had some too.   \\nI know Romney and Liz Cheney have a book that is out.

       "      <td>Hello everyone, could do with some advice/inputs from others who have crazy anti-vaxxer parents.\\n\\nI (31F)  live in a country where if you're not fully vaccinated and boosted you're basically not able to do anything (restaurants, museums, gyms, etc) - anything besides going to the supermarket. I need a booster now but am extremely nervous due to 2 interrelated things: I reacted quite badly to my second shot, and my mom is a very staunch and melodramatic anti-vaxxer.\\n\\nSo my bad reaction to the second shot was essentially that I had nerve symptoms (loss of sensation in feet, shooting nerve pains down my arms, weird headaches) and cardiovascular symptoms (palpitations, pain in chest). This was in addition to the usual dead arm stuff, which doesn't bother me in the slightest. Unfortunately this all happened when I was visiting my mom for a few weeks last summer and she went insane when I told her. She started crying, said I've \"killed her\" by getting vaccinated (I hadn't told her before) and considered herself \"proven right\" by the fact that I experienced anything other than the usual side effects. I am extremely health anxious and really, really had a hard time with these additional side effects. I honestly thought something really bad was going to happen to me and this was just the beginning. Throughout all this time, my mom convinced me, with some success, to try a bunch of \"cures\" to get the \"vaccine toxins\" out of my system. Needless to say, it was an absolutely horrible time and placed a lot of stress on my family (my mom basically convinced everyone I was dying).\\n\\nAnyway, the symptoms eventually improved, in about a month or two I was back to normal, more or less. I do have other health issues which have been exacerbated since the incident, notably my eczema and allergies are flaring up like hell, which of course my mom blames on the vaccine, but honestly are probably due to increased stress. I've been to see doctors but essentially they can't prove that my symptoms were caused by the vaccine. My GP says she won't issue an exemption certificate based on my symptoms but she didn't recommend getting boosted either, essentially telling me to do what I want.\\n\\nWhat I'm struggling with is the thought that maybe my symptoms were in part \"caused\" by my mom's craziness - that it's psychosomatic to a large extent. On the other hand, I hate if anyone suggests it wasn't \"real\" and that I \"probably imagined it\", because I definitely experienced these symptoms. I'm at a loss about what to do with the booster. I mostly don't want to go through what I went again, but then that means that I basically can't have a life anymore due to all the restrictions. I'm trying to not to talk to my mom anymore about health stuff but it's complicated, historically we have been super close and I would share everything with her. It's hard to get past that urge, especially when any health issue rears its head (I've had a lot over the past few months unfortunately). I feel like I am a rational person 99% of the time, but my mom has poisoned my mind on this particular issue and is very successful in eliciting a very fearful reaction from me. \\n\\nI know it's a very particular situation but I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and how they handled it. My friends are nice about it but no-one really understands this particular confluence of having an anti-vaxx parent, health anxiety and also scary (for me) side effects.\\n\\nTLDR: unsure if I should get boosted or not. Had scary side effects (numb feet and shooting pain in arms, heart palpitations and chest tightness for ~1 month) post 2nd shot but my reaction may have been in part due to the influence of my dramatic anti-vaxxer mom.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My husband (28M) and I (24F) been together 5 years, married 8 months. He came from an evangelical family with extreme right wing views. His father is undiagnosed autistic, he doesn’t believe in mental health so won’t get tested or help. He’s gotten more extreme with his Christian conservative beliefs as he’s gotten older. He was a dictator of his household &amp; did not allow his family to consume any worldly media (nothing but Christian music was worship was allowed). His kids could not go to school dances but their mom is basically normal so she helped sneak the kids to their proms. Because of his extreme beliefs he couldn’t hold a job. He was fired for blowing up about religion at work so he’s be unemployed since 2008 spending his days listening to Jimmy Swaggart &amp; watching Fox. Although he didn’t work he also didn’t contribute to the house or family. My husband was raised with strict gender roles in place except his mom was the breadwinner &amp; had to work 2 jobs for the family to get by. \\n\\nMy husband never had much of a relationship with his dad &amp; honestly until recently didn’t seem to like him because of what he puts his mom through. When we started dating he was normal. I have always been quite liberal and have leaned more and more liberal as time goes on. My husband leaned a bit conservative when we first started dating but it didn’t bother me much because he wasn’t a Trump supporter and I have a democratic parent and a (non Trump supporter) republican parent so I didn’t expect our political beliefs to have an effect on our relationship.\\n\\nA few months before our wedding I had a cancer scare and had to have some tests done to confirm. I didn’t tell anyone what the test were actually for because I didn’t want anyone to worry. I eventually told him the night before the tests because I was scared and want to talk to someone about it, plus I figured I’d get the results quickly so he wouldn’t be worrying long. Well I didn’t get the results for 2 weeks (no cancer) and he became super religious during that time. He was Christian but didn’t practice in any way, I think because of the religious trauma from growing up. That spiraled into him following religious creators on TikTok and listening to their harmful beliefs about non Christian non white people. I don’t know to what extent his conspiracy beliefs go to I know he \\n- doesn’t believe trans people “exist”\\n- thinks cis white men are the most under privileged people in the US. \\n- thinks Covid is fake and is anti vax. (He didn’t think this in 2020 and we got vaxxed together)\\n- does think men and women are equal \\n- thinks Trump being found guilty was Bidens fault. \\n\\nI hear conspiracy theory’s on his phone a lot but I don’t know what he believes. I’ve tried getting him off social media and told him I’d help him get a therapist but of course he’s worried therapist are making people gay (he went to therapy in 2020). \\n\\nWe’ve always wanted kids and had planned to start trying this fall. Last night he mentioned that when we have kids he will be the “leader” and raise the kids differently based on their gender and I have to follow what he says and he wants a traditional family and we’ll have to homeschool because schools are forcing kids to be trans and furrys. He said if we have a daughter he will not let her be a slut and his potential son will be thought to be a hard working provider and he’ll raise the kids to be straight. Basically went on and on with some obsession with people’s genitalia defining them and him being a leader and provider. \\n\\nI know it doesn’t matter but I’d like to point out that I have been the breadwinner for most of our relationship and would say that I also ‘lead’ the relationship because I’m the one making all the decisions, handling all of the finances, and making all of the plans. \\n\\nI asked last night if he thought he was being like his dad or if he feels like he’s slowing becoming him and he said no! I’m scared that he’s following in his dad footsteps. I feel like it’s my fault from stressing him out about the cancer scare and I knew I shouldn’t have hold him. I love him and want to help him get better and back to normal but I’m worried there is no hope for him because he was primed to fall into these beliefs from his upbringing.

       "      <td>Hi all,  \\nI am new to this subreddit, but glad I found it. Up until recently I didn't know this problem was so rampant.  \\nMy dad seems to have been taken in by these conspiracy theories I believe are related to QAnon. It has  consumed him, it's gotten to a point where having a conversation with him about anything is impossible.  \\nAnything and I mean *anything* can be related back to some bizarre conspiracy theory where the Government (or whatever illuminati) are trying to control us.  \\nTalking about movies? Nope, so and so movie stars speak out about Trump and are pandering to Chinese world domination.  \\nTalking about restaurants or food shopping? Nope, did you know that *THEY* are trying to make us eat insects instead of meat?  \\nTalk about traveling? Vaccine and controlling the population (nuff said).  \\nTry to talk about an article you read or a podcast you listened to? Nope, every single news site apart from the ones he reads has an agenda don't you know.  \\n\\n\\nNow, I've asked him not to talk about politics (multiple times), but he can't help himself. Also any attempt to challenge his beliefs even slightly results in him losing his temper and yelling,  \\nIt's also hard to argue against that level of insanity. According to him every website prints fake news (apart from the ones he reads), the fact checkers they have don''t print facts and yet anything that Trump says is taken as gospel.   \\n\\n\\nI'm at the point where I'm not sure what to do.   \\nWhen I see him I don't really want to spend our time arguing about this (every attempt to get him to consider another point of view is pointless).  \\nLike I said, I've asked him not to talk about it but he can't seem to help himself. Usually I can get him to move on by saying something like \"I don't know anything about that\", but later on he'll just bring up some other crazy thing.   \\nSo, like I said it's pointless arguing about this with him and asking him not to talk about it just doesn't work. It's also unfair to ask me to sit there and listen to this sh\\*t as it will just build resentment.  \\n\\n\\nI'm sorry for the rant, there are few people I can talk to about this, and I was comforted to know that there is a forum to share this stuff.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi everybody, long time no see. I made a post here about [three months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/ii2kvi/my_dad_and_qanon/) detailing my experience with my Qanon-believing dad, and in light of recent developments, I figured I'd ought to make an update on how everything is going. Spoiler alert: some good, but mostly bad. \\n\\nShortly after I made the post, I took the advice of a couple of people in the thread to go see a therapist about my dad and how he blew up at me over the BLM and antifa stuff, so I organized a meeting with the counselor at my university to discuss my relationship with him in addition to other stuff (my progress at school, my general mental health, my future, etc.), and I think it helped out a lot. We discussed a lot of things, but in short I told her the situation with my dad and how our relationship over the last couple of years has been affected by politics and Trump in particular, and she completely understood my qualms, and told me that refusing to engage in political discussions with him because of what they devolve into is a perfectly valid strategy, but that it would be a good idea to be easier on myself and to not be so hung up on things that could happen but worry about the stuff that will happen. She told me I was a very well-spoken and patient person, and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself a lot of the time or feel like any of the stuff he's said to me is my fault, and it's genuinely made me feel more optimistic about my future.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSecondly, I think I got him kicked off of Twitter, but he may still be on there and definitely has a Parler account. Basically, the Twitter account he was using a couple of months ago was apparently his third account that he's had since he keeps getting banned for breaking the rules, and basically while I was stalking his Twitter one day, he retweeted a couple of Ilhan Omar tweets saying he never wants a Muslim person like her to ever serve on the Supreme Court to make decisions for Americans, and around the same time, he was replying to people supporting Michelle Obama with a picture of Chewbacca with a caption saying 'please stop telling me I look like Michelle Obama'. I reported him for both of these types of things, just to see if anything would happen, and a couple of days later, I got a notification saying his account was suspended and when I checked it out, it wasn't just suspended, it was outright deleted. I've learned recently from my mom that he's apparently made another one but if he did, I don't know the username so I can't confirm it, and that he's also apparently moved on Parler as well, so that's not good.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIn October, my little brother, my dad and I all voted in the US election via absentee ballot; they voted for Trump, while I voted for Biden, and it was my first time voting in the election, and basically as the results for the election began to finalize and it looked like Biden was going to win, he was absolutely adamant that mass voter fraud in favor of Biden had occurred, that there was no legitimate way Trump had lost the way he did and that a landslide victory in favor of him was still possible and that they were throwing Trump votes right into the trash. I think it's reasonable to be skeptical of voter fraud happening, but absolutely no way to the extent that my dad was insisting it was happening, and it was around the same time that he was going on about Rudy Giuliani owning a copy of Hunter Biden's laptop data  (still not really sure what that was about?) and how apparently Tucker Carlson had a document with contents that would doom Biden's chances in the election, but it got lost in the mail from NY to California and was destroyed or something (also not sure what that was about). Basically he's been having a hard time believing Trump lost and is looking everywhere for a possible chance that he didn't actually lose and it's just part of Trump and Q's plan, and he's pretty bitter about the idea of Biden actually winning legitimately. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlthough it's not super Q-related, it all came to a tipping point the other day however, when my dad made a post in a community watch Facebook group he and my mom are in about how the police were raiding a gang headquarters down the street from where we live, and he capped off his post with a provocative comment basically saying \"take that, &lt;gang name&gt;!\". The group that they're is a pretty big one with a couple of thousand members in it, and basically as soon as that post went online, my mom called my dad at work asking him to take it down, because if a member of the gang saw that post and saw it was attached to his real name on Facebook, they could use that information to track him down and find our house, which is a real concern because the police apparently found several guns in the house they raided and they may have more, and the gun laws here in New Zealand aren't like the American ones so it's not as easy to defend ourselves from something like that. My dad strongly objected to this, saying my mom was being unfair and censoring him, and although he took it down, that wasn't the end of it. My mom was working from home that day, and when he came home from work, he had a massive argument with her about he's constantly tired of everybody being around the house all the time and how he's always getting censored and can never get time to himself, and he packed a suitcase and said he found a place he's going to stay at for a couple of days because he can't stand being around us at the moment. I wasn't in the house at the time this happened because I was at my work's Christmas party, but when my mom picked me up she told me what happened, and we talked about how aggressive he's been in general this year since we went in lockdown and how all this stuff about Trump and Qanon has done nothing but seemingly make him unhappy and irritable, and she agreed with a comment I made about it driving a wedge between us and him as his adoration and loyalty to Trump and Q grows. It's not making him happy, but he still thinks it's nothing short of the truth and as long as the narrative surrounding Qanon continues to benefit Trump as the savior of America, he's not going to stop. We also agreed that him constantly being suspended from social media platforms for promoting BS like Qanon and just being nasty to others online has probably made him feel this way about being censored the way he supposedly was by my mom. In short, he could've potentially endangered us by posting the way he did online, but rather than apologizing for it and recognizing his mistake, he thinks he's done absolutely nothing wrong, that we're somehow in the wrong for 'censoring' him, and rather than choosing to confront us and accept that he could've been wrong, he chose to run away and hide somewhere where we can't find him.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy little brother, mom and I were talking that night about him while he was gone about the role that he plays in our lives, and we've all come to the conclusion that while he's certainly loved by us, we can't deny that over the last year, he has been increasingly more frustrating and stressful to be around as he spent more time online over lockdown earlier this year and his political opinions became more and more radicalized. Before Qanon and even largely before a lot of Trump stuff he was already quite stubborn and unapologetic in everything he did, and both of them have only helped in reinforcing his attitudes and mannerism, and that in general, I personally think his presence and his attitudes have largely contributed to the degradation of my mental health in the last few years. It's only tangentially related, but I'm also a closeted bisexual, (as in, nobody I know knows) and I recently learned last night from my brother that he was saying some awful things about gay and trans people to him last week by calling them 'fudge packers' and 'tr\\*nn\\*\\*s' and saying it went against the will of God, so in addition to being unable to engage with him about politics, I also can't engage with him about relationships without revealing too much about myself, and I'm pretty sure as long as I live with him I can't be open about it or our relationship will tank if I do. My mom is constantly tired of him being bitter all the time and talking about how a big storm is coming every other week, how he constantly speaks in code and is absolutely certain that the deep state will lose, and she's genuinely hoping that Trump loses and falls in obscurity so the cult of personality surrounding him dissipates somewhat along with Qanon. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs of now, he has come home and he has had a long talk with my mom about how he overreacted, but he feels frustrated in regards to how there's constantly people around the home (likely referencing my mom working from home, and me and my brother on break after finishing our respective school years) and how he can never get alone time, how there's apparently always constantly something going on in the weekend, in addition to his work environment that I'm not sure about. My mom basically told him that it's not okay for him to up and leave like that, and that everybody was worried about whether he would return or not, and the wildly disproportionate response he had to being asked to take the Facebook post down was completely unacceptable, and she let him know that ever since lockdown started, he's become much more aggressive, both openly and passively, and that we don't appreciate being yelled at for interrupting him when he's listening to his Q podcasts or Fox News with his earbuds in. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs far as I know, that's as far it's gone and everything seems to be kind of back to normal, but since he's come back home, I've discovered that he's now started watching The Epoch Times on YouTube, has cited an Info Wars article on how he thinks Trump actually won, and my mom has since told me that we need to be vigilant and make sure he tones down on the podcasts and Qanon stuff. He and my little brother are also absolutely certain that Trump has won the electoral vote and will be president-elect, but it's looking like Biden won instead like the election results said, and he's made fun of COVID three times since his return and is insisting that the mortality rate of the virus is nowhere near what the numbers are saying and that there's a big narrative that's being spun by the mass media or whatever.   \\n\\n\\nTo conclude this, all I can say is that my patience with my dad is wearing thin, but I'm hoping that as we go into the new year, the reality that Trump has genuinely lost will finally sink in, and as Biden becomes president, maybe Qanon can finally dissipate a little and if I'm lucky, my dad can finally cut it out. I know that's probably a fool's errand at this point, but I want the world to heal from everything that's happened this year, and I am not at all interested in humoring hateful conspiracy theories like Qanon that do nothing but make people feel negative and awful. I'm angry at Trump, Qanon, Fox News, all the social media platforms and providers that enabled Q, and to some extent, even my dad, but I want to believe that we will be better equipped in the future to nip things like this in the bud, and maybe I can even have my dad back. Things like this can't last forever, and I hope that as Trump disappears from the public spotlight, maybe Qanon will too.</td>\n",

       "      <td>To put my dad's addiction into perspective, he has one bumper sticker for where I went to school for my bachelor's degree (in Criminology, go figure), one bumper sticker for my sister's career, and two bumper stickers for Qanon. All he listens to all day long are far-right conspiracy theories on YouTube like Qanon, Pizzagate, the Clinton's, etc. and digs himself deeper and deeper. It's gotten to the point that I accept it about him and have no desire to help him to get out of the hole he's created. If he's happy down there then, it can put the lotion on its skin. However, he does say some things that get me so frustrated that I can think about them for days at a time, but this one has had me flustered for a few weeks now. \\n\\nAnyway, he said a few weeks ago that there is no possible way that Joe Biden can win. Literally a 0% chance. I'm pretty sure I've seen some other posts in here of this nature. If he DOES win, it will have only been because of dirty liberals and the criminal illegal immigrants that the Clinton's bussed into the country that are conspiring to commit voter fraud. He basically won't accept the results of the election. For the record, I'm a centerist and I haven't told him who I'm voting for; he has assumed that I'm voting for Biden even though I literally have not decided yet and in the end I don't really care who wins. He has asked me in the past to explain the left's ideals to him since he groups me with them and he just can't wrap his mind how stupid the democrats' idologies are and I actually do my research on their ideas to stay informed on both sides. I've been happy to talk about politics with him in the past considering my background in Criminology but, since Q started it's been Guantanamo Bay style torture to try to talk to this brick wall of a man. That being said, as far as I can tell (so far, obviously) Joe Biden is projected to win. \\n\\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/)\\n\\nI'll be the first person to say that this projection could be complete ✨BS✨ and it could just be the media that I'm consuming that's creating a confirmation bias. Either way, I've been thinking about this fateful day in November if Joe wins for weeks. I'm positive it would be some kind of, \"Looks like the illegals came out to vote!\" type of badmouthing, as if this was some kind of sporting event instead of deciding on the next leader of our country. \\n\\nIf he would just educate himself on what voter fraud is, how it's checked for, how often it happens, how the prosecution/evidence in voter fraud cases works, which side of the political spectrum is more likely to commit voter fraud if either, etc. Basically if he did his due diligence as an American voter, we wouldn't be here. But I can't control him or force him to educate himself, especially since he won't listen to anything I send him research-wise anyway because the media is brainwashing me (/s). When in reality we all know that he's brainwashed himself. I've even tried to talk to my therapist about it and he said to realize that I have no control over what he thinks, which I have done my best to do. This is the only conversation that I haven't been able to get off my mind that has been kind of keeping me up at night. \\n\\n\\nWhat I'm trying to say is... Does anyone have an emotional plan for if their Qanon relative says something like this if this happens in November? Do you have anything planned to say? Does anyone have any advice on how they've worked through something like this with someone in their life before?\\n\\nTl;dr: My dad says the only way that Joe Biden can win is through voter fraud and I am unbelievably frustrated by that. I am scared for what he might say in November and I'd like to emotionally prepare. Advice?</td>\n",

Let them run loose and you'll jump from microchips to new world order to the end times in moments. They've a long history of mistrust in institutions and science (for my whole life they've been creationist Christians), so I see qanon as a natural extension of that and therefore deeply wrapped up in their self identity and world view. Letting go of any of it would be too transformational at this point for them, because it would mean letting go off creationism etc and all the rest of it. I've had many conversations and tried to teach them how to critically evaluate sources etc over the years to precisely zero effect, and for my own peace, I've had to recognise I'm not responsible for them or their thoughts, and I can't change their mind.\\n\\nIncreasingly, I'm seeing articles online and in the media on how to constructively engage with your qanon, with the aim of reasoning/changing their minds. Whilst I'm glad the research and info exists, and I hope lots of people use it to good effect, when I read it I just feel...tired. And guilty. And like a failure for not succeeding in changing their minds after thirty years of trying. And like a bad child and person for not wanting to put any more energy into it, when I have my own busy life to live, and talking about it with them makes me sad and hate them.\\n\\nI suppose I was just curious if anyone else felt similar?! For those of you still trying, you absolutely have my deepest admiration and I genuinely think lots of people's mind can be changed! But I also think there's some, like my parents, who are so far off the deep end it's impossible - just wondering if this resonated, I suppose?!</td>\n",

       "      <td>(Among other things)\\n\\nHello. I’m sorry I’m not sure this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but I’ve found no other active sub that would be better fitted. I desperately need to get this off my chest to people who would truly understand me, as it would seem like complete gibberish to those surrounding me. \\n\\nContext: Me and my soon to be ex husband (STBX) are from and live in the Middle East. We are fairly westernized, are completely fluent in English and have consumed Western/American pop culture since we were kids. \\n\\n\\nIn 2017, right after we married, he lost his job, turned on youtube for boredom, motivation and job-hunting tips and somehow ended up on Jordan Peterson’s channel. Cue days and nights of obsessive watching. Then he found Mark Dice, Lauren Southern, Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, Black Pigeon Speaks, and various “owning the libs/SJW are stupid” compilations, which ultimately led him to “JESSE PETERSON SAVAGE MOMENTS” compilations. For an idea of how fast this happened: in August 2017 we agreed that the Unite The Right rally was a terrible idea filled with terrible people and four months later in December 2017, he was showing me videos about the white “genocide” in South Africa and the big replacement in Europe. \\n\\n\\nAt first he was more obsessed with Jordan B. Peterson, so he was spending money on Jordan B. Peterson’s book of 12 rules of nonsense, buying his self authoring courses, buying his tshirts, then he started contributing to various patreons of questionable figures. \\n\\n\\nRight before the pandemic, he started watching Jesse Lee Peterson seriously. Since then, whatever frail good thing our marriage still had has been gone. JLP’s entire discourse is that women are crazy, evil by nature, controlling, as well as terrible opinions and advice about politics, the pandemic, vaccines, etc. My STBX regularly calls him on his show, and JLP responds with a spiritual word salad. \\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, my STBX’s opinions concerning the pandemic and vaccines are legitimately bullshit. 5G electromagnetic field heavy metals disturbing kind of bullshit. \\n\\n\\nI’m so tired of this! We’re separated but have a kid and I cannot believe I will have to parent this kid with him for the rest of our lives. He legit thinks I’m evil (like all women are by nature and a bit more on top) and want to deprive the kid of him as a father. The more he watches JLP, the more he’s convinced I’m evil, just a dumb woman whose views and opinions are useless, etc. And the more he becomes convinced that I’m going to hurt and mess up our kid and only sees my actions, thoughts, feelings through this fucked up lens. \\n\\n\\nI’m genuinely perplexed. Our political context is completely different. Our social context is different. The racial, feminist and LGBTQ issues that are present in the US manifest entirely differently here. There’s so much cognitive dissonance in what he believes, for e.g. he doesn’t believe in police brutality in the US, but he believes it happening here in our country. Plus, we live in the freakin Middle East for god’s sake. If he was so prone to being radicalized, wouldn’t it slightly make more sense if he was radicalized in a way that befits the culture/religion here? At least I’d have more help and resources to help him out of it. I’m heartbroken and confused. No one here understands what a word of all this alt-right whacko shit means. \\n\\n\\nWe’ve been separated for a month and are heading towards divorce. I can’t understand how someone so kind, funny, thoughtful, who was struggling with some personal issues turned into this paranoid delusional brute whose gibberish I can’t stand listening to. \\n\\n\\nRant over.

He hates where he lives now because it’s a more liberal state (despite the fact that HE’s the one who wanted to move there almost two decades ago). \\n\\nHe’s always been the kind of person who HAS to be right—even when he’s so obviously wrong, he never admits it til way later, so it’s not surprising, but still disappointing. He gets frustrated with me for not believing what he believes, and ironically, that makes me a sheep. Which is weird, because frankly, there’s propaganda on both sides, and you’re a sheep if you identify too heavily with ANY of it, but I digress. He’s always praised me for having good judgment and critical thinking skills, but anytime I disagree with him, suddenly I can’t think for myself and I’m just following the masses and listening to mainstream media (even though I don’t get my news from there lmao) and reading the wrong things. I just think that beliefs are very individualistic and complex and it’s not fair to say “my truth is the ONLY truth” and I extend that courtesy even to them. Except when their “truth” infringes on the rights of others. \\n\\nLike, if you don’t wanna wear a mask, fine. But understand that businesses can turn you away for it, and don’t act like that’s shocking? They can also turn you away for not wearing shoes or a shirt. When I said that you have to wear clothes to go in a store, he was like, “no, you WANT to. Who doesn’t want to wear clothes?” That’s... how do you miss the point by that much? He talks about mainstream media, and how everyone is living in fear, but HE’S sensationalising every bit as much. “Now it’s one mask! And some people wear two! The other day I saw someone wearing two masks and a face shield! What’s next?! Masks don’t even work, they’ve proven it!” Which... all of that is people’s personal preference? You’re going to talk about how people have rights, but get angry when they choose differently than you? He’s like “it’s only a matter of time before they start making us get the vaccine for everything, they’ve already done it for travel!” So... who’s living in fear again? You’re not afraid of the virus, but you’re afraid of wearing masks because it’s damaging to your oxygen levels or whatever, and you’re afraid of getting the vaccine. Fear is normal. We’re all afraid, in different ways. It’s asinine how conservatives act like they’re exempt from fear just because they operate around it differently. \\n\\nLike, he wanted to compare “my body, my choice” for abortions to wearing masks. Hello???? Are you for serious right now?? No one is LEGALLY making you wear a mask. Stores are privately owned and have a RIGHT to turn you away, and he’ll agree with that and then complain about it in the next breath, like it’s some kind of persecution. Also, in what world is wearing a mask for 20 minutes, half hour while you go into a store equivalent to carrying a baby inside you for nine months, pushing it out and raising it for 18 years or knowing it exists out there somewhere with another family if you put it up for adoption?\\n\\nEven more infuriating, is I’ve been learning more about core beliefs and how they run your life. We’re all just operating on beliefs we formed when we were young, and oftentimes aren’t even aware of. Our brain LOVES to be right, which is why confirmation bias is a thing—your brain will often twist anything to fit your already existing narrative, especially if you don’t watch it and question it. I can’t be angry at people for falling victim to that in a society that doesn’t teach us about it and leverages it against us with constant propaganda. So I reach out after, and text like, “I understand it’s frustrating to you and that you just want what’s best for me, but you should be able to respect other people’s beliefs because things are more complex than you’re giving them credit for” basically (also because I’d seen him calling other relatives of his things like “liberal scum” and asking another relative how she even stands them, which is... very Christian™️ of him) and he said it’s not his truth or my truth but THE truth, and implies that he knew nothing at my age and everything he’s learned has been through age and experience, and that basically by my age he’d already been in the military and was married with a kid, which is such a stupid measure of like, experience and intelligence, which is, again, subjective and individualistic. So, what, someone who is never in the military or never gets married or has kids even well into adulthood is never going to know as much as someone who does? Ugh. \\n\\nI know most of this is all just.... typical Q shit, but sometimes it’s so frustrating, and I just need to vent. So, thank you if you read 😂</td>\n",

Then something snapped, in July she suddenly got DEEP into Q. She would send me texts talking about Hillary’s laptop and her eating people and anthony buordain getting high off of adrenochrome. Talking about how trump will be the end all be all, and discussing that feminism is a sham to oppress us. Discussing how Kamala harris was supposed to hurt Biden and take over as the communism queen. \\nAll of this, whilst emotionally abusing me. She was never a nice mom, undiagnosed BPD and many mental and mommy issues of her own. She treats me like fucking shit. I am terrified to block her because after trump losing , I’m scared she is going to kill herself. She was there for me when my real dad was not, and it is just terrifying to see. I think my step dad (who is into trump but not a Q die hard), may end up leaving her if she doesn’t stop. She will lose everything if he leaves.

       "      <td>This is what it’s like to be brought up on the extreme unhinged end of this reactionary conspiracy shit to the fucking hilt. This is an environment that isolates children for radicalization, stockpiles rations and ammunition, and is prepared to shoot lots of people in a hypothetical societal collapse. And they're real excited about a collapse.\\n\\nThis is part 11 of my project reviewing all the darkness of this upbringing. I'm also running a volunteer project to talk with and help others recognize if they need to get out, or help someone out. If you want some help and advice for you or anyone you know personally, please read my aggregate post and PM me. I also answer questions there.\\n\\n[My Whole Brain is Fucked Up or: How to Escape the Accelerationist Militia that Raised You as a Child Soldier in Extreme Generational Poverty](https://redd.it/tea2vj)\\n___\\nNo one in my father's family radicalized him, I'm sure of it. For all of my grandfather's failings in his household, he was consistently on the right side of building a better society when presented with the most difficult of choices.\\n\\nMy father shared on a few occasions that in the 60's my grandfather somberly told the dinner table that he killed nearly 100 Germans on that day decades earlier. As a bombardier flying over the Mediterranean his squadron was able to square up with a surfacing German submarine lined up at a British naval vessel. In what the extended family has tried to research as possibly the first such occurrence in combat, my grandfather sunk it.\\n\\nI believe it was after this he transitioned into a navigator. Some time in a later engagement, he leaned over to pick up his pencil and shrapnel tore through his flying tin can over his head. When they came to land, much of the squadron was missing. The flight surgeon saw this Michigan kid's shell shock and wouldn't let him off the ground again. He took the downtime to get a degree, then his commission.\\n\\nThe colonel in time came around to telling me the story about that bombing run, but very differently. This would be May of 2007, a few years after we completed his transition to assisted living. He was riding the excitement of his youngest grandkids flying all the way across the country to see him. He had a completely different energy level in an environment that provided access to more nutrients than the orange juice he watered his Jack Daniels down with. At one point he started wheezing and laughing asking if we knew how many Nazis he killed and talked about the flight.\\n\\nHe also might have been playing it up a little bit feeling outnumbered. The hospitality arrangements were made by my aunt, his oldest of three. Her husband until his tragic passing legally represented communities and whole neighborhoods in petitions to HUD. Friends he had made in a Japanese neighborhood kept a room open in their assisted living community until the colonel was ready to move in.\\n\\nThis sounds like trouble, but my grandfather radically dropped sixty years of racism against the Japanese within weeks once they invited him to play hearts. The problem was he kept trying to impress upon his kids how wonderful it turns out they actually were. My aunt, who maintained close relationships with this neighborhood for decades was ***MORTIFIED*** after they spoke with a young staff member welcoming them back from a lunch date. He turned and quietly confided to everyone living on that floor: *\"You know, I always thought the Japanese were homely... but they're GORGEOUS!\"*.\\n\\nAnother time, lecturing my uncle who came to visit:  \\n\"The Japanese are actually a REALLY lovely people!\\n\\n...\\n\\n... except for Pearl Harbor\"\\n\\nHe gets no points for subtlety or still speaking with sweeping generalizations, but he was voicing aloud his realizations that this racism had gone unchallenged for 60 years and made sure his kids kept up. My uncle was a combat translator in some of the thickest shit in Vietnam, and probably still spoke at least one east-Asian language fluently. He was laughing so hard he was crying while trying to get his father to politely shut the fuck up in the hallway.\\n\\nAs soon as my grandfather got to flirt and play cards with them, he realized he loved his vices more than hate. Much like he became a Braves fan watching local broadcast in South Carolina, he had now become a Mariners fan. He went to nap in his chair more than once even in the brief time I was there waiting for the batting order to turn over to bring back up Ichiro.\\n\\nThere's more to the relationship my uncle and grandfather each had with east Asia. And it was real fucking good work. Let me share this by way of the two well-known reasons that my grandfather never made full-bird in his 35 years.\\n\\nThe first would be my uncle's charismatic fire in the early 60s. The USAF then more than they do now expected you to keep your family in order, especially as an officer. My uncle as a young teenager became good friends with the base commander's son. On a wild drunk, they took swings at some MPs trying to split them up and get them home. They must have known them by name and probably would have been happier with these kids' fathers not knowing theirs. As a transparent demonstration cracking down on this shit, my grandfather shipped my uncle off to military school. It was very much a \"you two don't have a brother anymore\" situation.\\n\\nThe second reason keeping him out of the brass would come several years after the first. My uncle was still enjoying all the same vices his father loved. Going hard, he lost a bet and subsequently enlisted in the marines. [I talk about this trauma and his strength here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowledgeFight/comments/tubulj/mwbifu_a_deep_dive_into_where_my_father_became/?). In this horrific time, my uncle and grandfather reconciled. The colonel requested transfer into Vietnam to substitute out his son. My uncle was quickly in front of congress as witness to American atrocities. It had been his responsibility to know these people and be able to talk with them in confidence.\\n\\nMy grandfather did field intelligence in east Asia years before. Once in Vietnam, he refused to be party to the system fudging statistics and hiding atrocities. His career ground to a halt, and he was out of the air force by '74. It's probably why he refused to be buried until 2010, to make sure he used that comfortable military pension to day drink, court widows, and watch baseball more than all his time in the service.\\n\\nFor all their personal faults and their shared history of violence, my uncle and his father took it upon themselves to be a team and do the right fucking thing against war criminals. No one in this family gave my father any real push into his radicalization as a right wing terrorist. The colonel may have provided instruction on domestic violence techniques, but not hate. Even after having his keys taken away due to his advanced age living in South Carolina, he saw my little brother and I play basketball with the black families living together down the street. He made sure he had a way to vote for a 2002 referendum to increase his property taxes to fund more schools.\\n\\nThis doesn't narrow things down much, but that radical is going to be one of the conspiracy-guzzling libertarians my father met in the 80's years before my time.\\n\\nWhen the colonel died, my uncle received the flag and spent rifle casing from the military funeral. My father wasn't happy, clearly narcissistic enough to believe he had any stake in the bond they formed speaking up for innocent life. The colonel had the steel to look a glad-handing spy in the eyes holding a gun to his heart and make them acknowledge both of their outfits would forgive him for shooting them. I wonder how easily the colonel was able to see through my father, if he was the kind to coward to be on the comfortable side when presented tough choices.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hi everyone,\\n\\nI feel a mixture of guilt and satisfaction over this event. . .  This post will be long but I need to write this as a form of catharsis for myself. \\n\\nI am a longtime lurker of this sub as I’ve been watching family on all sides go down the Christian nationalist/fascist path. . . I was raised liberal but have always been surrounded by conservatives, being from Texas but always living in cities. My husband is from East TX and he is the only liberal in his entire family. He escaped East Texas, which he calls “the land that time forgot”, went to college, and we met. We’ve been together for 9 years and married for 7. We are a normal couple. We are liberal af. I love him so fucking much. \\n\\nI’ve always gotten along with my husband’s family because they reminded me of my own large, crazy family growing up. As I get older I realize this is nothing to idolize but alas, psychology. \\n\\nI’ve made every effort to show kindness and love towards my husband’s family and to bond with them since I met them. I actually love(ed) them very much. He is one of 8 and I quickly became beloved by the younger teenagers and kids especially, throughout the extended family. For example, my husband’s younger sister came out to me as a lesbian MONTHS before she ever told anyone else— and when she did, she was promptly banned from the family. She actually moved in with me and my husband for 6 months rent free while she got on her feet. A few years later, my husband’s 14 yr old niece came out to me as well. I have been that safe person for the young ones growing up in that shitty family system. \\n\\nI also host the kids every year at my family bay house for a week as well as let her s teenage brother come over for ~1 month by himself every summer to get away from his crazy family. I’m saying all of this because I want y’all to understand how hard I’ve tried.\\n\\nThere have been a few political squabbles in the family over the 9 years I’ve been with my husband and I am not totally innocent in that regard. My husband will ALWAYS, without fail, be antagonized for being liberal at one point or another during our visits to East TX (5-6x/year). For example, for all four years of Trump’s presidency, my husbands mother gifted trump gold coins to him at Christmas. 4x. She is a horribly abusive woman— physically, emotionally, financially, the whole gambit. She is a classic evil family matriarch— the source of all the dysfunction and someone who tears the family apart rather than bringing it together. She wouldn’t even shake my hand the first time she met me. Just because. She’s also told me I’ll be a bad mother. I could keep going. She’s honestly always been so over the top insane that it’s been easy for me to write her off. \\n\\nSome of the older siblings take after her with their QAnon type beliefs but generally we just grin and bear their one or two insane comments at the whatever gathering it is. For example, his mother and oldest sister are nurses (I am too) and they love to say that they have multiple patients who died from the Covid vaccine. Our way of handling this has been to ignore it, change the subject, make a joke. For the sake of the family. We never, ever bring up anything political. \\n\\nAnd I’ve never said a thing to her or any other his siblings who take after her, except for a couple clever retorts here or there on the bullshit articles they would post on Facebook, or a dirty look while they poke at my husband.\\n\\nSo yeah. In April this year, my mother was diagnosed with aggressive stage IV breast cancer. This was obviously completely devastating news. My mom is under 65, healthy as a horse (weight, bloodwork, exercise etc) and has had clear mammograms, including her most recent. It’s an insanely aggressive cancer and this summer has been so hard. I’m the eldest and I’ve been her caretaker. Her prognosis is decent but cancer is a rollercoaster. We are doing the best we can. \\n\\nThe younger sister that lived with us had a baby shower a couple months ago. When she broke up with her girlfriend, she immediately got knocked up by a man, had a shotgun wedding, and was promptly welcomed back into the family. I could not bring myself to go to this shower because I had just found out about my mom. \\n\\nMy husband went and when he got home, I asked what his family said about the news. I fully expected a sympathetic and supportive response from them bc our relationship with all the siblings was so strong. Like, the two youngest had just spent a week and a half at our house near the gulf. \\n\\nInstead, my husband told me that both his oldest sister and his mother immediately said that it was probably because my mom took the vaccine and uses 5G. They have met my mother as she hosted them in her home several times.\\n\\nI felt numb for a few days because it was just so silly. But then something in me just snapped and I sent his older sister a very mean text. \\n\\nI said “my mother has graciously hosted you in her home. a vile hag like you doesn’t deserve to even look twice at someone like my mother. Enjoy rotting away in that shithole you call home. Get fucked.”  \\n\\nI sent the text to her directly but she then forwarded it to the whole family and acted like she had no idea what it was about. Everyone rallied to her side including those who I’ve helped so drastically in the past. The family is firmly united in hatred for me now. \\n\\nMy husband didn’t try to stop me or ask me to change what I said. He’s been very supportive but I can tell that my new-found vitriol for his family is starting to make him uncomfortable. I know he’s disgusted with them as well, but of course he can’t match my new, and very pure, hate.\\n\\nIt’s been a couple of months and I just can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve never hated someone so much or been so disgusted. . I fully plan on never speaking to any of them again, excluding the teenage brother who said he understood why I said what I said. \\n\\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to handle this going forward? When I inevitably see them again? And how to deal with this with my husband?\\n\\nIf you made it this far, I salute you.\\n\\nFuck all these brain -rotted freaks.\\n\\nEdited for grammar</td>\n",

Long story short, she helped me through my darkest time yet while I was caring for my dying grandma and my family seemingly dropping (almost) everything on my shoulders. So, when she got deep depp *deep* into Q because of the Save The Children thing, it hurt.\\n\\nShe and I bonded over our shared hobby of the occult. I'm the kind of guy that *loves* history and the occult is just an extension of that.

The idea is sound; mental disorders that would cause people to believe they're werewolves or vampires. Sleep paralysis and walking visual and auditory hallucinations when you're half asleep causing you to see ghosts. Schizophrenia, mass hysteria, gaslighting from narcissists.

Like some CW's Supergirl equivalent that can also be hokey and overly ridiculous. Or, should I go full force and show just how destructive, hurtful and outright dangerous the real QAnon really is?\\n\\nI've already decided to study it like I do the occult.

       "      <td>My Uncle was always there for me. No matter who I was, I believed he'd love me regardless. I remember an incident when a family member told me that I was an embarrassment to the family because I “voted for a socialist” and my Uncle called him and said, “if you ever say anything like that to my niece again, you'll have me to answer to.” \\n\\nHe never talked about politics. I didn't even know he liked Trump. For 20+ years of my existence, he kept that part of himself separate from our relationship. Until the pandemic hit. That's when he started down the rabbit hole. I didn't know what QAnon was until May of last year when my Uncle posted the plandemic video. \\n\\nMy mother, who is a nurse and deals with COVID-19 a lot, and I tried to reason with him. If not for himself, then for my grandparents who are well into their 70s and both have health issues. He couldn't be reasoned with. He refused to wear the mask. He told us to “do our own research and we'll see.” \\n\\nOf course, in May / June of last year, the Black Lives Matter protests also started. I remember posting about the police brutality on Facebook and my Uncle responded with a comment, calling me a “butthurt leftist.” I told him to back-off and he told me to start caring about “the eight million children that go missing every year” instead of BLM and Antifa. \\n\\nI unfriended him on Facebook, thinking that'd be the end of it. He called me back-to-back three times and I didn't answer. He texted me, “You put a major wedge between us. When it's clear, you will owe me a MAJOR I'm-fucking-sorry-for-everything. I can't believe what you're about now. I'm ashamed to call you my niece. When will you all arm up and get rid of us?” \\n\\nHe also left a voicemail where he said “This is the last time you and I are probably ever gonna talk cus I never want to talk to you again. Don't consider me your Uncle. Go ahead and write me off.” \\n\\nI loved this man more than my own father. When I came out, he embraced me when others wouldn't. He told me he loved me unconditionally. I go to therapy and I try to work through it, but I don't know if I can forgive him for tossing me aside the way he did. It felt effortless, like I never really mattered.   \\n\\nI know that was a lot to read through. I appreciate every person who has posted here. I'm both sad and comforted by the fact that I'm not alone. I hope all of you have some success in bringing your loved ones back. And thank you for letting me tell my story.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My mom was an antivaxxer long before facebook existed. It led to her choosing not to have me vaccinated *ever.* I'd get dragged to antivax rallies at the capitol and had to see doctors to get medical exemptions filled out. It wasn't as much of a social issue pre-COVID, but now......it's hell. I'm living with my parents and brother while I finish my degree, and she makes everyone in the house take ivermectin (the horse version) and hoards hundreds of types of vitamins. I *want* to get vaccinated for COVID, but she would lose her mind. My high-risk dad got Pfizer in early March and had a bad allergic reaction (which is a valid concern for me as well, but the risk of having a reaction is necessary to exist in the outside world now). My mom *lost her mind.* She saw my dad getting the shot as a betrayal of her trust and diminished her power in the household. I had to write a religious exemption letter for my fucking college because I'm terrified of what she might do if I got the shot independently.\\n\\nThe last two years have been bad, but it got worse when the world started opening back up again. It's been really difficult to see my friends going out and doing things and I'm stuck at home with my abusive qmom. Bad combination for a severely depressed extrovert. Lotta alcohol and a lot of spiraling. Hell, I'm trying to make plans for a birthday dinner with my aunts and my mom is forcing me to change them because of a contact tracing guideline she read for SCHOOLS. Something that's not relevant to restaurants with outdoor seating on a *Monday night*. I'm just......so tired. Tired, frustrated, angry, desolate. I just want to interact with the outside world again.\\n\\nEDIT: First, please don't tell me how easy it is to get vaccinated and that I should just go do it. I can't do so until I'm out of the house, away from my mom, and have the financial stability to risk getting really fucking sick. i have no idea how my body will react to any vaccination. Second, she has control over too many aspects of my life and I don't want to think about what would happen if she found out while I was living at home. I'm 22, but I can't drive and she tracks all my internet history.</td>\n",

She said that as they were leaving a bus pulled up and all these Chinese men got off. She said that now there are all these Chinese men coming over the border and they have cell phones and they wear suits and they are pulling rolling suitcases, and they look like business men going to a job, and then they get added to all these buses of illegals being shipped all around the rural area where she lives. then she said right after that there was a bus load of Hondurans. \\n\\nWait I said. Chinese immigrants? I haven’t heard that we’re getting a bunch of immigrants from China. She said they’re coming over the border! And I said, what border? China is on the other side of the planet. (as we learned from cartoons, it’s straight down when you dig.) And she said they’re coming over the Mexican border and I said why are they coming over the Mexican border and she said ask Biden. I don’t think I have the energy to watch Fox News but they must suddenly be on about Chinese people because that’s the only place she gets this. For a long time she has been saying that there are these white buses with no windows that come out of nearby small towns, late at night, and then all the local small towns just have these people dumped there. And they stay in the hotels and they get free healthcare and they get free cash and some of them get free cars and they don’t have to get vaccines and none of them speak English, and the men are rude when you meet them on the sidewalk.\\n\\nIt’s a lot I know. She complains that she sees them (first Mexicans, most recently Africans) at Costco and they’re buying up all the meat and I’m thinking but it’s a store. It is literally there to sell food.</td>\n",

       "      <td>She (F37) has been running a fever for 10 days with no sign of improvement. She's pretty much bedridden. Yesterday I (F47) suggested she request steroids from a doctor, to stave off any inflammation that may be setting in. My Q brother (M35) convinced her to call one of those Frontline doctors and get ivermectin instead, which she did. That doctor also gave her a prescription for antibiotics, with the assumption there is an underlying infection. I'm not necessarily convinced she has an infection at this point, but they probably can't hurt. Q bro and my extreme healthnut sister (F45) are still going on about the dangers of modern medicine, telling her to trust her body and not take the antibiotics, and are singing ivermectin praises. Maybe ivermectin would have worked if she'd started it on day 2 or 3, but everything I can read about it online suggests it's probably too late at this point. The fact she is choosing that over steroids is freaking me out. I hate that she let herself get into this position by not getting vaccinated or social distancing. \\n\\n Exact quote from my brother today in the family group chat: \"Since when did we start agreeing or trusting the medical establishment?\" How about when our sister is clearly suffering from a preventable illness? He and another brother (M43) have spent the last year ranting about population control and how the media is lying about Covid, telling me I've been brainwashed by watching the news. It should be obvious who the brainwashed ones are at this point!\\n\\nThey also tried to talk my parents out of getting vaccinated, which luckily didn't work. My mom (F68), dad (M72), youngest sister (F31), and BIL (M26) all received the J&amp;J today. I hope it's not too late. They live in Florida and are anti-maskers so it will be two weeks before I feel I can stop worrying about them.\\n\\nI have seven siblings, who I've been close with all my life. Until Trump and the pandemic, we were mostly on the same page politically, with only our parents being what is considered conservative. My sister (the one with Covid) went from discussing with me who she would vote for in the Democrat primaries in early 2016, to voting for Trump in November of that year, based solely on his stance on vaccines. I just can't get past the irony.</td>\n",

I've found that my sister sees people who are dead, and hears voices that aren't there. I've chalked it up to drinking in the past, and she is a VERY emotional person. But lately she's been quoting Q stuff in our family chat on FB, and I can't. I just can't. I had pretty successfully stopped telling her it's all crap, until the day before yesterday, when I decided to share Biden's speech about getting the vaccine and masking, etc. in the family chat, because they - all of them in my family - are trump supporters and anti-vaxxers and I felt called to share truth.   \\n\\n\\nAs usual, my older sister (the crazy one), referred to trusting in God to keep her from harm. I also am a believe and trust God for many things, but I really don't believe God means for us to turn our backs on His provision of vaccines, as well as all our food etc. They eat the food gladly - and their deteriorating health shows it - but vaccines they've decided are from the devil \"libertards\", which they call me when I'm not in the chat. The other day, my older sister starting quoting more Q at me. She often sends the stuff to me unsolicited when I'm innocently  minding my own business. We have had a pact for a long time not to send each other stuff. So that's why I decided to send Biden. I guess it was wrong of me, but she broke the rule multiple times lately with no response from me. She quotes scripture to support the madness, and how all sorts of nutsy things are about to happen according to her favorite website, and how the things now happening to stop trump or his followers are all evil and from the devil and going to bring the Second Coming. Well, my younger sister got into it with me the other day for my measured words attempting to debunk their sheiss. I didn't want to get all argumentative at them, but they revealed how they talk about me in the family, which is like I'm a black sheep and brain washed and following lies etc. etc. etc. So their adult kids have their point of view. Since I've avoided arguing I haven't been able to show them the truth. My older sister refuses to get the vaccine and her mentally challenged husband as well, even though they are caretakers for our mother who is 92 and has heart failure, and very much would get the vaccine if it wouldn't kill her. At least our mom avoids people already anyway, but my sister and husband go out to church meetings and don't mask and don't distance, and none of those people believe in the vaccine, and they all seem to believe in the Q sheiss.   \\n\\n\\nAnd I'm wasting so very much time dealing with my feelings of being misrepresented and even ostracized in some ways by this family that used to be known for its love, I just can't stand it. I'd be advised by a therapist, most likely, to just walk away. I wish I could. I should probably just get yet another facebook page without my family in it, but they follow me and it's really hard to not accept them as friends because normally they ARE so loving and kind. It's this whole stupid political thing and Q that have them all blindly running as fast as they can over the cliff! Well, this is just a lot of venting, I guess. I wish I were one of those higher life forms that can just shake it off and forget it. But I'm not. I need a family. :'(  Sorry to ramble so much. And now I have to go. I have an appointment. Have a good day, and good luck to you all!</td>\n",

I haven’t been close to him since we were children, but every time we would speak on the phone, it would be the same thing (wanting to talk about conspiracy theories, rejecting vaccines, calling me and my husband lefty scum) ya know, normal stuff.  Regardless, I agreed to go to Christmas dinner, for the sake of my Mother. \\n\\nSo, here is where it gets worse. Sibling has now got a swastika tattoo right next to a Totenkopf, displayed on the inside of his arm. He kept sitting in a position where he would lift his arm behind his head, to pretend he was relaxing or whatever. He then pulled out a MAGA hat (we live in Australia..). \\nHe absolutely knew what he was doing. He didn’t verbally say anything, but he was deliberately provoking us with everything he was doing. Needless to say, we left with our kid, before dinner started. My Mother called me crying and blaming us for overreacting and told us to “just not look at them”. \\n\\nI’m feeling very sad and mentally exhausted from this entire thing. I have this sinking feeling and I keep bursting into tears, but I will absolutely not be in the same room as this person again. I will not sit at the table and play happy family with a Nazi. I will not teach my child that this is what we do. \\n\\nSo friends, here is me from the future with some wisdom. Don’t go to that Christmas lunch/dinner if you don’t want to. Your happiness is worth more than someone’s feelings. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR - Sibling is now a neo nazi and I “ruined Christmas” for leaving once I noticed the tattoos. \\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hey this is just an aimless rant without much interesting in it, sorry-- just wanted to get it out somewhere where folks might understand. Just feel really alone about all this. \\n\\nSo, my (21) mom (60F) has always been something of a conspiracy theorist, ever since I was a wee thing. It went hand in hand with all her weird spiritual, new age stuff. She keeps on trying to talk to me about this conspiracy/Qanon shit and I just shut down. Mhm. Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. Huh. Because I used to engage, and in the end her opinions would make me so upset that I'd usually end up, uhh, crying. (Hey, I was a hormonal teen, and I've always sort of been a crybaby in the first place. Plus, finding out your mom is a trump supporter when you are openly gay can kind of be a lot.) My actual opinions would scare her a little, since I'm pretty far left. So I just barely react. Let her go on and on. And because of this, she thinks we've got some kind of fuckin...rapport. Since I don't shut her down like dad does. Like oh you're so good at listening, oh you're so good to talk to about this. And she's doing it more and more often lately. \\n\\nI feel like I'm a support system for someone I don't support. It fucking sucks. But she's my mom, and she's a good person deep down for the most part, just gullible as shit (long history of being in mlms and getting into cult shit), so I don't want to hurt her feelings by biting back. When I told her I felt like I couldn't trust anything she says because she gets all her info from disreputable places, and that some of the things she says really scare me, she started crying. And it's like, man! I don't wanna make my mom *cry!* It's just...ugh. What I wouldn't give for her to not be into this shit. \\n\\nI guess I'm also worried about her relationship with dad. I feel like all this is really putting a rift in their marriage. He gracefully put up with her spending hundreds on classes to hone her ✨empath✨ abilities and talking about bigfoot being an invisible extradimensional hyperintelligent alien at war with *other*, similarly alien bigfoots (bigfeet?), and all that bullshit, but he gets downright nasty whenever she brings up politics now and it results in a lot of cold shoulders and mutual hurt. But honestly, I'm jealous of him. Wish I could speak my truth like that, y'know?</td>\n",

Since the election is over, now, his main topic is the collapse of the dollar, the end of the IRS, and how we need to be prepared. He's asked me not to share details, \"because it could put our lives and our loved one's lives in danger\".  I have been very vocal that I think all these ideas are garbage and last week used the word \"delusional\".  He is now angry with me \"I've supported you all these years. \\[I have chronic fatigue, and rest a lot\\].  All I'm asking is that you show me the same respect.  You haven't even taken the time to do the research, but you would rather take the word of others than to research it yourself, and come to the same conclusions as me\".

I’m not as concerned for myself if I were to attend, since I’m fully vaxxed, but I wouldn’t be comfortable going knowing I could potentially play a part in transmitting covid to my unvaxxed family members, especially the older people like my grandparents. \\n\\nDespite everything, I still love them, and I’m sad that I don’t have a way of maintaining these family relationships or attending events without actively endangering their health. Many of them, including my mother, also have no verbal boundaries and refuse to talk about anything other than the vaccine/ivermectin/the conspiracy of the day. My mom in particular seems to enjoy ignoring/running over my boundaries. \\n\\nI know that their choices have led to this situation, but I still feel shitty for ignoring/declining every single invitation. Some of my more normal cousins (who are vaccinated) still attend, I think to help them maintain some internal feeling of normalcy, so I end up feeling like I’m being unreasonable or overly cautious by avoiding these events. When I try to communicate my boundaries and my concern for the antivaxxers’ health, I’m shut down and basically told that I’ve been brainwashed. \\n\\nHow do you cope with the recklessness and stupidity of it all? Do you just turn down invitations like this without explanation to avoid conflict, or would you bother to explain why you’re not comfortable attending? \\n\\nAlso, thank you for this community.

I am the only non-Q in family at this point. Rest of my story is elsewhere, but you can imagine my persona non grata status. I had just gotten to a good place with the lack of funeral and closure, then BAM! here comes the text last night…there is going to be a funeral. At a military cemetery. My Dad didn’t even care about his short time in the military and was a conscientious objector. He went for the electronics training and to avoid rumors of the upcoming Vietnam draft (if you enlist I guess you have more job options). He did have a penchant for conspiracy theories my entire life and was no doubt stocking up on ivermectin. \\n\\nAaannddd cue the crazy … now everyone treating this like he was a bible thumping war hero except no one seems to know his rank, years of service, honors, stories, favorite verses, etc for the funeral. I DO know all those things and appear to be the only one. Even my husband knows and my own older brothers don’t. I literally never saw my Dad reading the bible my whole life. He definitely believed in God but hated church. He did like those bible conspiracy books written by self-published pastors from Nowhere, USA stocking their bunkers for the End Times. \\n\\nSo I guess I’m going to be leaning on you guys for the next month again. Ugh things were going so well. Now I regret telling the universe I needed closure even after she whispered back “Are you suurre??” I’ll be walking straight into Trumplandia and the Greek tragedy that is my family.\\n\\nUpdate: Here’s a real treat. After you guys so bolstered my confidence and offered support past 24 hrs, I woke up to a text and youtube from my oldest brother (on same group chain about funeral) “proving” that the “Dem Army” [??] is going around shooting cops in the head because “woke” corporations are funding BLM who I guess are using the money like a mafia to murder the innocent. I can take lizard people and Canadian royalty in RVs all day long, but the racist stuff ugh. Best part? Our mom was a bilingual Mexican/navajo who lived in poverty as a child.\\n\\n8/21 Funeral Update: After a LOT of soul-searching I decided to go to funeral. The “wake” will be at the house. Since I have the historical photos, recordings I took of his stories, notes, diplomas, etc I told stepmom I’d make memory video. Not some lame thrown together sad photo montage. We’re a movie industry family. I’m talking a cool if not campy 1950’s “movie short” docu style (upbeat and fun). I make these for the holidays and my Dad loved them. Stepmom wrote back and said “not to put any effort into this” because she decided against it. They married after mom died when he was almost 60. He had this whole ass life before her. Really cool interesting stuff no one seems to know. Obviously I’m still making it and putting on my youtube channel reserved for family history stuff (not just him). I knew something hurtful would happen, I just wasn’t expecting this.</td>\n",

It felt like a movie where if you're a conservative parent, there's no escaping the absurdity of the beliefs they hold but it does it in a fairly gentle way as to prevent them from putting their guard down.\\n\\nThis movie ruled and looking into it's production is funny because Disney dropped it. You're results may vary but yeah she's seemed to understand where I'm coming from now and is stepping through a mirror. \\n\\nI feel kinda bad because all I wanted was her to change but now it just feels weird.

I also heard her talking to the local agriculture store asking if they had ivermectin and our horses have already been recently dewormed this year. My sister and I have talked to her and explained that they could put anything in the drugs from India because it’s not FDA regulated and the dosage for horse ivermectin is well…..for horses. She then belittled us and called us ridiculous saying that ivermectin is curing COVID. She got vaccinated at the beginning of the year but I has fallen into anti-vax propaganda . So she’s not getting the booster. My mom is a nurse and I can’t believe she’s fallen for this. I’m afraid that she’s going to catch COVID, take ivermectin, and I’m going to find her dead from poisoning herself or any other complications.

       "      <td>My Q and I have a “no talking politics” rule. We had to make that rule in the first place because we had a falling out a few years ago when I posted a meme making fun of Trump on my Facebook story. That was out of character for me, while she constantly posted making fun of democrats or calling them all evil and pedophiles. She saw my story and completely went off on me, eventually escalating to making hurtful personal attacks. I finally told her I was done with her and blocked her. \\n\\nShe apologized 9 months later and I forgave her, with the condition that we will not talk politics with each other. \\n\\nI respect this rule. She does not. She has always made comments here and there but it has been a lot worse lately. I always side step her comments, don’t react and let it go to keep the peace. \\n\\nI am so sick of her talking about not being able to support her kids if Kamala gets elected, or how Kamala is going to take all the guns, or how the illegals get all the free handouts she doesn’t get as a single mom. \\n\\nWe recently went out for a nice day at the winery. On the way there, she was saying how a lifelong Democrat warned people not to vote Democrat this election and how dangerous that would be. I didn’t mention the republicans who have endorsed Kamala Harris. I just let it go. On the way home, she talked about how Tim Walz signed a bill making it okay for the state to take custody of children away and transition them against their parent’s wishes. Not true, but I let it go. \\n\\nI’m also sick of her always making it seem like her opinion is fact and the democrats are just too stupid or blind to see it. \\n\\nWhen I said I don’t believe that all of Hollywood is a secret pedophile ring that drinks babies blood for adrenochrome to stay young, she told me it’s absolutely fact but “some people just can’t wrap their heads around it and that’s okay.” \\n\\nJust recently, I expressed some anxiety about our friendship potentially having trouble with the tensions being so high before the election. She said we will be fine and don’t need to talk about it. Then immediately said “I will say this though, we are about to become a third world country if people don’t get their heads out of their asses. But I won’t argue with people about it.” I assume she’s referring to everyone who is not voting Trump having their heads in their asses, therefore talking about me. \\n\\nI am over it. So this morning, I snapped. I didn’t personally attack her, but I was definitely not nice and told her I never do that to her and that I am sick of hearing it.\\n\\nWe have not spoken since. I plan to reach out and talk at some point but I don’t know what to say. I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t know how to repair it or if I want to. I thought it would feel a lot better to tell her off about it, but I just feel sad. I don’t know why they can’t just not talk about it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Just a heads up - this is going to be a long post and I will start from the beginning. \\n\\n  \\nMy family is white, conservative, and well-off. Both my parents have college degrees and are less than 50 years old. My mom raised me and my six younger siblings in the midwest US while my dad worked and ended up having a lucrative career. She homeschooled my siblings and I for a portion of time (early elementary to early middle school for me until I started going to public school again). I was never a stranger to hearing Rush Limbaugh on the radio, going to a John McCain rally on my 8th birthday instead of getting a small birthday party that I had begged for months in advance, hearing that evolution and climate change aren't real, etc., etc. It just got worse and worse as time went on but because she was my mom, who is the adult and knows best, I just went along with it. \\n\\n  \\nMy high school was definitely liberal-leaning, but because of my upbringing and a couple of people I was friends with, it was fun to troll the super left-leaning kids and talk about Trump winning the 2016 election and stuff like that. I regret all of it and towards the end of high school, started to come around a little bit.\\n\\n  \\nI ended up going to a large university where I was (thankfully) around a lot more progressive people who weren't batsh\\*t crazy. A couple of my closest friends listened to me talk about things and opened up my mind to what life is like outside of crazy conspiracy theories and seeing things from a different viewpoint. I ended up becoming pretty passionate about politics and it sent me strongly in the other direction that I had been in for such a long time. \\n\\n  \\nCovid hit and threw a wrench in my freshman-year university experience. I was forced to go back home and be around my family and realized my mom was starting to lose it. Background for her - she comes from a pretty similar situation where her dad worked a long, hard job but was successful and had a large family. However, he was extremely abusive and always said terrible things to my mom, physically hurt her and my uncles, and eventually drove her out of the house. We eventually cut off contact with them, but I know it has affected her more than she is willing to admit. My parents were strict but not abusive and tried to create a loving home, which I will say they did a great job of. I have been close with my siblings all my life.\\n\\nDuring spring 2020, she was always talking about how COVID isn't that bad, how masks don't work, blah blah blah. The vaccine was developed and even though Trump said it is ok and people should get it, she wouldn't budge. She would constantly send conspiracy theory articles in our family group chat and I started challenging them eventually. One time, she sent out a Fox News-like Article with a title along the lines of \"Plane crashes into chicken farm - foreign countries targeting US food supplies?\" and a list of multiple incidents, specifically fires, that were destroying farms and thus the food in the US. I stayed up all night and wrote a paper criticizing her with legitimate sources, not the one she used. I wish I could find it now, but there were literally adult ads with graphic images on the website - only legitimate sources would have those, right? She was ANGRY the next day and didn't talk to me for two days (would ignore me in the house) until my dad came to me. He said she was so upset that I would attack her and asked me to apologize. Eventually, I did. The person who used to get mad at me for using Wikipedia as a source now quotes websites like \"childrenshealthdefense.net\" with p\\*rn ads all over them as gospel. And I'm the bad guy for calling her out. \\n\\nI love my dad but he's part of the problem at this point. He lets her say whatever she wants and when her feelings get hurt, he asks me to make the peace. I do lash out a little bit and try not to insult her, but I did a couple of times. I haven't done that since late 2021 and just gave up fighting back. I worry about my siblings being brainwashed by her because I definitely was, and already I can see it when my fourteen-year-old brother reposts Trump pics on his Instagram account. At the end of the day, he's going to make his own decisions but it's just so stupid. \\n\\nAnother crazy thing - on January 6th, 2021, the day of the incidents at the capital in DC, I was planning on driving to my college town to break up with my girlfriend at the time and spend some time with friends. In my college town. In the center of the Midwest. My mom said \"Just be careful, I think some things are going to go down today\" as I left. Looking back, I've been wondering if she was in some Telegram or other communication platform chats that involved Jan. 6th personnel who stated what they were going to do. She knew in advance, 100%. Why else would she have said that? She believes the election was stolen, people are constantly out to kill Trump, that he is going to shine a light on the world order that truly runs the world, blah blah blah blah blah blah. \\n\\nI'm a couple of years out of college now and don't know what to do. I moved across the country and am living with a woman I plan to marry one day, but she is the opposite of my mother, and very turned off by her. She has stated multiple times, and I agree, that our potential future kids will not be around their grandparents if they continue their behavior. It goes against what I have always wanted, but I just don't want them to be around them like this. My girlfriend's parents are also nuts in a different way, so she's been able to empathize, and we may end up having no grandparents involved one day. \\n\\nOther stuff has happened too, there were some medical and legal power of attorney documents that my parents wanted me to sign before I moved away. For context, they had wanted me to sign them since 2020 but scrambled to get their ducks in a row and finalize the documents once they knew I was moving. I understand their viewpoint but disagree with them having a final say on what happens to me over a doctor with years of medical experience. My girlfriend thought it was a jab at her, which I understand. The POA situation may be a different issue, but I expressed my concerns with it and my mom flipped out. My dad asked me to please just sign it and I could go back and do whatever I wanted later. He knows she is in a \"delicate place\", (literally his words) and is just trying to keep things going smoothly. Because of him, I am also an avoidant person who just tries to smile and make everyone happy, but I don't really want to do that anymore. \\n\\n  \\nAt this point, I am at my wit's end. I am so fed up with seeing crazy headlines or brainless texts in my family group chat that I just ignore (it is very rare that anyone responds, it's just my mom spewing endlessly without a response), and don't know what to do anymore. I don't want it to affect my relationship now, and my girlfriend feels uncomfortable being around my family knowing what they stand for and what things they say and believe. It's embarrassing to have a parent with Trump flags in the house who made me never want to invite friends over and who made me become the laughingstock of my friend group because of her tinfoil hat political beliefs. I don't think it's worth fighting her over it, I don't really enjoy being around her anymore but I do like being around my siblings and my dad. My dad doesn't even fight her on it anymore, as far as I know, and nothing has changed in the last four years. If anything, it's just gotten worse. She doesn't believe in treating mental health (which was fun to deal with when I almost hurt myself and knew she would have opinions about me seeing a therapist) so I know that's off the table. I don't fight her anymore or argue, I just kind of smile and nod Madagascar penguin style. We text every few days and call like once a week, and it's hard to cut off contact with my literal mom. \\n\\nI work remotely in a new state that I moved to less than four months ago and haven't made many new friends. I am definitely at a low point and this situation is definitely not helping. \\n\\nAm I doomed for eternity or is there anything worth trying?</td>\n",

I decided to check out their webpage, which at first just looks like a regular blog, with lovely pictures of their homestead.\\n\\nThen I started reading the posts. Within the first three pages, I ran into rage-filled rants on the Great Reset, chemtrails, weather control, the evils of vaccines and the \"sheeple\" who take them, the New World Order, how they stopped touring because the pagan music industry is demonic, transphobia, and then charged right into the \"Cabal\" and \"Jewish-run media\". The language was aggressive and hateful, calling everyone \"sheeple\".\\n\\nI guess I always think of the people in the Q and Q-adjacent groups as always being American, fundamentalist Christians of many flavors, right wing, straight laced, etc. \\n\\nThese guys are European, tattooed, dreadlocked, nature-worshipping, things the other Q's would absolutely lose their mind over - but they're both spouting the same poison.\\n\\nI know this isn't as bad as the issues the people have with family and friends deep into this nonsense.

I'm not from the US, but i find many similar elements of the QAnon conspiracy spreading even here.\\n\\n\"Bill Gates and the satanic elite have created the coronavirus as an excuse to chip us all so that we can be mind controlled  by the 5G network! Oh and they're all blood drinking pedophiles hell-bent on putting placentas and aborted foetuses into LITERALLY EVERYTHING\"\\n\\nThis is only a slight exaggeration, but only a slight one, as anyone who has spent an extended amount of time speaking to these people can attest.\\n\\nThat isn't to say that every conspiracy theory is necessarily false, just look at MK Ultra. Though there's a slight leap i believe between \"the government is doing shady shit and \"there's a cabal of satanists trying to murder the planet, who may or may not be lizard people (read: jews)\"\\n\\nTrying to shoot down the many.. many obviously false and ludicrous claims has drained a lot of my energy, and quite frankly a good chunk of my sanity too. Why? Well, here's an example:\\n\\nEarly on in the pandemic there were images and stories floating around of a green canister with \"COVID-19\" photoshopped on it. If i remember correctly the image itself was older than the pandemic by quite a lot, besides the fact that it was painfully obvious that the text was added digitally. \\nWell, not obvious enough apparently as it spread through social media of many different countries.\\n\\nOr how about that \"5G tower motherboard with COVID19 printed on it\", that was actually taken from an old VCR? Like you could look it up by a code printed on the board and see where it came from.\\n\\nThis wasn't just random misinterpretation of information that just became viral, this was purposeful disinformation put out there to feed into this growing lunacy. Why? Is it 4chan just pulling shit to mess with people to get a laugh? It's either that, or there's a conspiracy to spread conspiracies around to put the masses into panic mode so that no one gets vaccinated and we all DIE or the global economic system collapses and the lizard people can finally take over the world and drink baby blood out of capri sun packages!\\n\\nYou see what this shit is doing to me? I'm not actually serious about the second part of what i wrote but goddamn does the madness spread. And there's nothing you can do about it.\\nIt has become like a religion, and your belief in the conspiracy is the only way you can reach salvation and therefore those caught in this madness believe it's their moral duty to convince you that it's true so that you don't get microchipped by Microsoft!\\n\\nWho the fuck keeps spreading these lies? Why?! AAAAAGH!\\n\\nAnyway, sorry this rant got so long and thanks for reading. I'm just extremely frustrated by what is happening.</td>\n",

       "      <td>My mom's been married to this dude (in the Western definition) for 20 years and for the first we were ok. Pre-2016 he was hippie-conservative - into bikes, western dance, Ren faires, camping, hiking, making stuff, collecting, guns, zombie TV, and libertarian politics. He was loud and a egotist who butted into everything. \\n\\nA classic loud Boomer. Made my 26-13 year old young family feel very unhappy with his ranting about gays, trans, and immigrants. They could hardly stay for holidays.\\n\\nThen from 2016 he went total Q and she followed along. Their senior friend group destabilized as everyone ran off to prep for the apocalypse. And then COVID hit and drove them deeper in.  \\n\\nHe ff'd up so many warehouse jobs shooting off his mouth he decided the city was out to get him. They sold their house by the grandkids and started RV living. And we lost them - wandering TX due to OK being \"too.liberal\" :/ \\n\\nApparently he then lost them multiple jobs in TX due to being a Q asshole and alienating Parks Service admin and guests as a host. \\n\\nMeanwhile, mom, 75 is trying to find a job to make up the difference. She's in great shape, but is into quack and natural cures, thinks big medicine is hiding knowledge because Cayenne pepper is a magic cure, and pretty much everything about magical metals, cures, herbs, salts, and shady treatments for cancer. That's actually nothing new - but it puts her in the cross hairs of Q algorithms. \\n\\nShe tries a job for 2wks and quits if she feels she's not being respected enough. (But unfortunately can't operate computers/phones very well anymore)\\n\\nLong story short - he yeeted her because she wasn't respecting him and correcting him, plus not enough kinky sex. (Remember she's 75, but looks about 55-65, but still.)\\n\\nI'm slowly deprogramming her now since she moved in with me into my new home\\nI ask questions.\\n\\n Just questions and empathize two things \"You are very smart and lived through a lot, why would you still believe something that's been prove untrue after 70 years of experiencing it never being true or happening?\"\\n\\nAnd \\n\\n\"Have you ever seen this happen in reality? Have you ever had someone you know irl tell you it happened right in front of them irl?\"\\n\\nI checked her phone - 100s of open tabs. I removed Fox News and told her the AP was corrupted. I showed her how to use her Drive and Office 365 (which of course her computer subbed her to.)\\n\\nThe worst part - she thought she HAD to give him 50 percent of her tiny savings in a divorce. So she preemptively did that. He spent it on his pepper compound and needed more. So he pretended maybe they get back together.\\n\\nSo she went into reverie. And I pushed it because I told her - if she moved in he could never come here or stay here. And I told her I wasn't comfortable for applying for a job in my center where I would be her direct supervisor. (Just because she tells everyone my personal business. No filter. And outright hates on Black people whom I work with a lot.)\\n\\nAnd so 5 months passed. He nearly killed her once passively - like clearing brush on the coldest day of the year. She started getting chest pains then drove herself 60 miles to the hospital /not wanting him to think she was weak. Hypothermia.  \\n\\nSo final blow - he took her out for a event and later ******* and SA her. And she immediately called me and asked to come.\\n\\nIt didn't have to be this way. But boomer gen has a lot of untreated trauma and mental illness. The constructs of the nuclear couple create fears and shame - from unplanned pregnancy to \"dying alone.\"\\n\\nWhat I said \"You are not dying alone if you live with family. You might not have a man, but it sounds like you don't really want a man, you want a friend or friends. Women in our family usually outlive our men by 25 years or more. So in the end you would be with family.\"\\n\\n(Truth is - if she would have stayed with him she would have ended up caring for him and his death thores from untreated cancer and outlived him while being abused financially and physically while living in a 1 room prepper shack far from medical care.)\\n</td>\n",

                    Hey guys. I was relieved to discover this community because I have felt so alone in this struggle. \\n\\nI'm living at home for one more semester of community college before going to university. \\n\\nWithin the past two years that I have moved back in with my parents I have noticed a change in my dad. \\n\\nHe was always my hero. The guy I would rely on for all sorts of advice. We were so similar. \\n\\nHe received an injury that made it harder for him to be active and with that came this uptick in \"research\". My dad was always into politics, conspiracy theories, and other things of that flavor online.  However, he doesn't have the same kind of media literacy that I do, and started reading blog posts for his information.\\n\\nHe never would go to the doctor, but has become an anti-vaccer. He thinks it caused the autism my brother has. \\n\\nHe started spiraling. He is up in the morning, looking at his phone. He watches the x22 report and His Glory every single day. These are glorified infomercials and he has fallen for many of them, buying the things that these evil people promote.\\n\\nThe way those people mix Christianity in with their beliefs of the \"great awakening\" that the \"storm is coming\". I can see so clearly that these people are selling snake oil, but my dad doesn't see it this way.\\n\\nHis ideals haven't always meshed with mine. I'm an artsy type and a woman. I have overheard him say over the phone that women are social and have made this country socialist, \"Look what happened when we let them vote.\" \\n\\nHis wish for me was to get married, have kids (and homeschool them) and be a wife to my future husband. Well, I'm a lesbian (have always known I was from age 9).\\n\\nMy dad will send me emails about the conspiracies. In fact, he sent me a text while I was at work from a woman (last name Barnhardt) who thinks that contraception is killing children who would be born and therefore all contraception is evil. I looked at this website further and saw what makes my stomach twist. LGBT people being called sodomites and equated with pedophiles.\\n\\nI always knew I would never come out to my parents, but this recent event was the final nail on the coffin. I'm biding my time until this semester concludes and I can leave. I am sad because I know I can never come back home, that it isn't safe for my mental health. \\n\\nI wish there was a way to save my dad from this conspiracy, but unfortunately the times I have tried are met with his cognitive dissonance and the dogma he has adopted so righteously.\\n\\nI will always love my dad, but the cult he is in makes it impossible for me to have a relationship with him.\\n\\nIf you are in a similar situation, please tell me about it so I feel less alone. This whole time I have felt so isolated with this deep loss. It's like watching someone you know get taken away and replaced by a stranger until they are unrecognizable.\\n\\nEdit: a couple other things I want to get off my chest:\\n\\nMy father thinks ANTIFA under disguise were the people who stormed the capital because they have tattoos.\\n\\nHe believes that Trump is the truest President of the United States since Ulysses Grant and not the \"corporation\" of the United States (like Biden is).\\n\\nHe believes there are children being held hostage by the cabal (the thirteen bloodlines and hollywood) and cannibalized/sexually abused.\\n\\nHis beliefs keep getting worse. I'm so tired. I just want my dad back.   \n",

                         I need a gift for my Dad this coming holiday. For over 50 years I would hear him make comments that the Democrats are messing up this country. He will vote for Trump again. He says he gets information from multiple sources but makes excuses for Trump. When I would ask him about Trump's classified documents he would say that Biden had some too.   \\nI know Romney and Liz Cheney have a book that is out. I think if there was one from General Milley my father maybe more accepting of his side of the story. Anyone have good books that my father can read to open his eyes to the insanity of the Republican party?   \n",

parents.\\n\\nI (31F)  live in a country where if you're not fully vaccinated and boosted you're basically not able to do anything (restaurants, museums, gyms, etc) - anything besides going to the supermarket. I need a booster now but am extremely nervous due to 2 interrelated things: I reacted quite badly to my second shot, and my mom is a very staunch and melodramatic anti-vaxxer.\\n\\nSo my bad reaction to the second shot was essentially that I had nerve symptoms (loss of sensation in feet, shooting nerve pains down my arms, weird headaches) and cardiovascular symptoms (palpitations, pain in chest). This was in addition to the usual dead arm stuff, which doesn't bother me in the slightest. Unfortunately this all happened when I was visiting my mom for a few weeks last summer and she went insane when I told her. She started crying, said I've \"killed her\" by getting vaccinated (I hadn't told her before) and considered herself \"proven right\" by the fact that I experienced anything other than the usual side effects. I am extremely health anxious and really, really had a hard time with these additional side effects. I honestly thought something really bad was going to happen to me and this was just the beginning. Throughout all this time, my mom convinced me, with some success, to try a bunch of \"cures\" to get the \"vaccine toxins\" out of my system. Needless to say, it was an absolutely horrible time and placed a lot of stress on my family (my mom basically convinced everyone I was dying).\\n\\nAnyway, the symptoms eventually improved, in about a month or two I was back to normal, more or less. I do have other health issues which have been exacerbated since the incident, notably my eczema and allergies are flaring up like hell, which of course my mom blames on the vaccine, but honestly are probably due to increased stress. I've been to see doctors but essentially they can't prove that my symptoms were caused by the vaccine. My GP says she won't issue an exemption certificate based on my symptoms but she didn't recommend getting boosted either, essentially telling me to do what I want.\\n\\nWhat I'm struggling with is the thought that maybe my symptoms were in part \"caused\" by my mom's craziness - that it's psychosomatic to a large extent. On the other hand, I hate if anyone suggests it wasn't \"real\" and that I \"probably imagined it\", because I definitely experienced these symptoms. I'm at a loss about what to do with the booster. I mostly don't want to go through what I went again, but then that means that I basically can't have a life anymore due to all the restrictions. I'm trying to not to talk to my mom anymore about health stuff but it's complicated, historically we have been super close and I would share everything with her. It's hard to get past that urge, especially when any health issue rears its head (I've had a lot over the past few months unfortunately). I feel like I am a rational person 99% of the time, but my mom has poisoned my mind on this particular issue and is very successful in eliciting a very fearful reaction from me. \\n\\nI know it's a very particular situation but I'm wondering if anyone has experienced something similar and how they handled it. My friends are nice about it but no-one really understands this particular confluence of having an anti-vaxx parent, health anxiety and also scary (for me) side effects.\\n\\nTLDR: unsure if I should get boosted or not. Had scary side effects (numb feet and shooting pain in arms, heart palpitations and chest tightness for ~1 month) post 2nd shot but my reaction may have been in part due to the influence of my dramatic anti-vaxxer mom.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                 My husband (28M) and I (24F) been together 5 years, married 8 months. He came from an evangelical family with extreme right wing views. His father is undiagnosed autistic, he doesn’t believe in mental health so won’t get tested or help. He’s gotten more extreme with his Christian conservative beliefs as he’s gotten older. He was a dictator of his household & did not allow his family to consume any worldly media (nothing but Christian music was worship was allowed). His kids could not go to school dances but their mom is basically normal so she helped sneak the kids to their proms. Because of his extreme beliefs he couldn’t hold a job. He was fired for blowing up about religion at work so he’s be unemployed since 2008 spending his days listening to Jimmy Swaggart & watching Fox. Although he didn’t work he also didn’t contribute to the house or family. My husband was raised with strict gender roles in place except his mom was the breadwinner & had to work 2 jobs for the family to get by. \\n\\nMy husband never had much of a relationship with his dad & honestly until recently didn’t seem to like him because of what he puts his mom through. When we started dating he was normal. I have always been quite liberal and have leaned more and more liberal as time goes on. My husband leaned a bit conservative when we first started dating but it didn’t bother me much because he wasn’t a Trump supporter and I have a democratic parent and a (non Trump supporter) republican parent so I didn’t expect our political beliefs to have an effect on our relationship.\\n\\nA few months before our wedding I had a cancer scare and had to have some tests done to confirm. I didn’t tell anyone what the test were actually for because I didn’t want anyone to worry. I eventually told him the night before the tests because I was scared and want to talk to someone about it, plus I figured I’d get the results quickly so he wouldn’t be worrying long. Well I didn’t get the results for 2 weeks (no cancer) and he became super religious during that time. He was Christian but didn’t practice in any way, I think because of the religious trauma from growing up. That spiraled into him following religious creators on TikTok and listening to their harmful beliefs about non Christian non white people. I don’t know to what extent his conspiracy beliefs go to I know he \\n- doesn’t believe trans people “exist”\\n- thinks cis white men are the most under privileged people in the US. \\n- thinks Covid is fake and is anti vax. (He didn’t think this in 2020 and we got vaxxed together)\\n- does think men and women are equal \\n- thinks Trump being found guilty was Bidens fault. \\n\\nI hear conspiracy theory’s on his phone a lot but I don’t know what he believes. I’ve tried getting him off social media and told him I’d help him get a therapist but of course he’s worried therapist are making people gay (he went to therapy in 2020). \\n\\nWe’ve always wanted kids and had planned to start trying this fall. Last night he mentioned that when we have kids he will be the “leader” and raise the kids differently based on their gender and I have to follow what he says and he wants a traditional family and we’ll have to homeschool because schools are forcing kids to be trans and furrys. He said if we have a daughter he will not let her be a slut and his potential son will be thought to be a hard working provider and he’ll raise the kids to be straight. Basically went on and on with some obsession with people’s genitalia defining them and him being a leader and provider. \\n\\nI know it doesn’t matter but I’d like to point out that I have been the breadwinner for most of our relationship and would say that I also ‘lead’ the relationship because I’m the one making all the decisions, handling all of the finances, and making all of the plans. \\n\\nI asked last night if he thought he was being like his dad or if he feels like he’s slowing becoming him and he said no! I’m scared that he’s following in his dad footsteps. I feel like it’s my fault from stressing him out about the cancer scare and I knew I shouldn’t have hold him. I love him and want to help him get better and back to normal but I’m worried there is no hope for him because he was primed to fall into these beliefs from his upbringing. What do you think??   \n",

              Hi all,  \\nI am new to this subreddit, but glad I found it. Up until recently I didn't know this problem was so rampant.  \\nMy dad seems to have been taken in by these conspiracy theories I believe are related to QAnon. It has  consumed him, it's gotten to a point where having a conversation with him about anything is impossible.  \\nAnything and I mean *anything* can be related back to some bizarre conspiracy theory where the Government (or whatever illuminati) are trying to control us.  \\nTalking about movies? Nope, so and so movie stars speak out about Trump and are pandering to Chinese world domination.  \\nTalking about restaurants or food shopping? Nope, did you know that *THEY* are trying to make us eat insects instead of meat?  \\nTalk about traveling? Vaccine and controlling the population (nuff said).  \\nTry to talk about an article you read or a podcast you listened to? Nope, every single news site apart from the ones he reads has an agenda don't you know.  \\n\\n\\nNow, I've asked him not to talk about politics (multiple times), but he can't help himself. Also any attempt to challenge his beliefs even slightly results in him losing his temper and yelling,  \\nIt's also hard to argue against that level of insanity. According to him every website prints fake news (apart from the ones he reads), the fact checkers they have don''t print facts and yet anything that Trump says is taken as gospel.   \\n\\n\\nI'm at the point where I'm not sure what to do.   \\nWhen I see him I don't really want to spend our time arguing about this (every attempt to get him to consider another point of view is pointless).  \\nLike I said, I've asked him not to talk about it but he can't seem to help himself. Usually I can get him to move on by saying something like \"I don't know anything about that\", but later on he'll just bring up some other crazy thing.   \\nSo, like I said it's pointless arguing about this with him and asking him not to talk about it just doesn't work. It's also unfair to ask me to sit there and listen to this sh\\*t as it will just build resentment.  \\n\\n\\nI'm sorry for the rant, there are few people I can talk to about this, and I was comforted to know that there is a forum to share this stuff.   \n",
       "2622   Hi everybody, long time no see. I made a post here about [three months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/ii2kvi/my_dad_and_qanon/) detailing my experience with my Qanon-believing dad, and in light of recent developments, I figured I'd ought to make an update on how everything is going. Spoiler alert: some good, but mostly bad. \\n\\nShortly after I made the post, I took the advice of a couple of people in the thread to go see a therapist about my dad and how he blew up at me over the BLM and antifa stuff, so I organized a meeting with the counselor at my university to discuss my relationship with him in addition to other stuff (my progress at school, my general mental health, my future, etc.), and I think it helped out a lot. We discussed a lot of things, but in short I told her the situation with my dad and how our relationship over the last couple of years has been affected by politics and Trump in particular, and she completely understood my qualms, and told me that refusing to engage in political discussions with him because of what they devolve into is a perfectly valid strategy, but that it would be a good idea to be easier on myself and to not be so hung up on things that could happen but worry about the stuff that will happen. She told me I was a very well-spoken and patient person, and that I shouldn't be so hard on myself a lot of the time or feel like any of the stuff he's said to me is my fault, and it's genuinely made me feel more optimistic about my future.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSecondly, I think I got him kicked off of Twitter, but he may still be on there and definitely has a Parler account. Basically, the Twitter account he was using a couple of months ago was apparently his third account that he's had since he keeps getting banned for breaking the rules, and basically while I was stalking his Twitter one day, he retweeted a couple of Ilhan Omar tweets saying he never wants a Muslim person like her to ever serve on the Supreme Court to make decisions for Americans, and around the same time, he was replying to people supporting Michelle Obama with a picture of Chewbacca with a caption saying 'please stop telling me I look like Michelle Obama'. I reported him for both of these types of things, just to see if anything would happen, and a couple of days later, I got a notification saying his account was suspended and when I checked it out, it wasn't just suspended, it was outright deleted. I've learned recently from my mom that he's apparently made another one but if he did, I don't know the username so I can't confirm it, and that he's also apparently moved on Parler as well, so that's not good.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn October, my little brother, my dad and I all voted in the US election via absentee ballot; they voted for Trump, while I voted for Biden, and it was my first time voting in the election, and basically as the results for the election began to finalize and it looked like Biden was going to win, he was absolutely adamant that mass voter fraud in favor of Biden had occurred, that there was no legitimate way Trump had lost the way he did and that a landslide victory in favor of him was still possible and that they were throwing Trump votes right into the trash. I think it's reasonable to be skeptical of voter fraud happening, but absolutely no way to the extent that my dad was insisting it was happening, and it was around the same time that he was going on about Rudy Giuliani owning a copy of Hunter Biden's laptop data  (still not really sure what that was about?) and how apparently Tucker Carlson had a document with contents that would doom Biden's chances in the election, but it got lost in the mail from NY to California and was destroyed or something (also not sure what that was about). Basically he's been having a hard time believing Trump lost and is looking everywhere for a possible chance that he didn't actually lose and it's just part of Trump and Q's plan, and he's pretty bitter about the idea of Biden actually winning legitimately. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlthough it's not super Q-related, it all came to a tipping point the other day however, when my dad made a post in a community watch Facebook group he and my mom are in about how the police were raiding a gang headquarters down the street from where we live, and he capped off his post with a provocative comment basically saying \"take that, <gang name>!\". The group that they're is a pretty big one with a couple of thousand members in it, and basically as soon as that post went online, my mom called my dad at work asking him to take it down, because if a member of the gang saw that post and saw it was attached to his real name on Facebook, they could use that information to track him down and find our house, which is a real concern because the police apparently found several guns in the house they raided and they may have more, and the gun laws here in New Zealand aren't like the American ones so it's not as easy to defend ourselves from something like that. My dad strongly objected to this, saying my mom was being unfair and censoring him, and although he took it down, that wasn't the end of it. My mom was working from home that day, and when he came home from work, he had a massive argument with her about he's constantly tired of everybody being around the house all the time and how he's always getting censored and can never get time to himself, and he packed a suitcase and said he found a place he's going to stay at for a couple of days because he can't stand being around us at the moment. I wasn't in the house at the time this happened because I was at my work's Christmas party, but when my mom picked me up she told me what happened, and we talked about how aggressive he's been in general this year since we went in lockdown and how all this stuff about Trump and Qanon has done nothing but seemingly make him unhappy and irritable, and she agreed with a comment I made about it driving a wedge between us and him as his adoration and loyalty to Trump and Q grows. It's not making him happy, but he still thinks it's nothing short of the truth and as long as the narrative surrounding Qanon continues to benefit Trump as the savior of America, he's not going to stop. We also agreed that him constantly being suspended from social media platforms for promoting BS like Qanon and just being nasty to others online has probably made him feel this way about being censored the way he supposedly was by my mom. In short, he could've potentially endangered us by posting the way he did online, but rather than apologizing for it and recognizing his mistake, he thinks he's done absolutely nothing wrong, that we're somehow in the wrong for 'censoring' him, and rather than choosing to confront us and accept that he could've been wrong, he chose to run away and hide somewhere where we can't find him.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy little brother, mom and I were talking that night about him while he was gone about the role that he plays in our lives, and we've all come to the conclusion that while he's certainly loved by us, we can't deny that over the last year, he has been increasingly more frustrating and stressful to be around as he spent more time online over lockdown earlier this year and his political opinions became more and more radicalized. Before Qanon and even largely before a lot of Trump stuff he was already quite stubborn and unapologetic in everything he did, and both of them have only helped in reinforcing his attitudes and mannerism, and that in general, I personally think his presence and his attitudes have largely contributed to the degradation of my mental health in the last few years. It's only tangentially related, but I'm also a closeted bisexual, (as in, nobody I know knows) and I recently learned last night from my brother that he was saying some awful things about gay and trans people to him last week by calling them 'fudge packers' and 'tr\\*nn\\*\\*s' and saying it went against the will of God, so in addition to being unable to engage with him about politics, I also can't engage with him about relationships without revealing too much about myself, and I'm pretty sure as long as I live with him I can't be open about it or our relationship will tank if I do. My mom is constantly tired of him being bitter all the time and talking about how a big storm is coming every other week, how he constantly speaks in code and is absolutely certain that the deep state will lose, and she's genuinely hoping that Trump loses and falls in obscurity so the cult of personality surrounding him dissipates somewhat along with Qanon. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs of now, he has come home and he has had a long talk with my mom about how he overreacted, but he feels frustrated in regards to how there's constantly people around the home (likely referencing my mom working from home, and me and my brother on break after finishing our respective school years) and how he can never get alone time, how there's apparently always constantly something going on in the weekend, in addition to his work environment that I'm not sure about. My mom basically told him that it's not okay for him to up and leave like that, and that everybody was worried about whether he would return or not, and the wildly disproportionate response he had to being asked to take the Facebook post down was completely unacceptable, and she let him know that ever since lockdown started, he's become much more aggressive, both openly and passively, and that we don't appreciate being yelled at for interrupting him when he's listening to his Q podcasts or Fox News with his earbuds in. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs far as I know, that's as far it's gone and everything seems to be kind of back to normal, but since he's come back home, I've discovered that he's now started watching The Epoch Times on YouTube, has cited an Info Wars article on how he thinks Trump actually won, and my mom has since told me that we need to be vigilant and make sure he tones down on the podcasts and Qanon stuff. He and my little brother are also absolutely certain that Trump has won the electoral vote and will be president-elect, but it's looking like Biden won instead like the election results said, and he's made fun of COVID three times since his return and is insisting that the mortality rate of the virus is nowhere near what the numbers are saying and that there's a big narrative that's being spun by the mass media or whatever.   \\n\\n\\nTo conclude this, all I can say is that my patience with my dad is wearing thin, but I'm hoping that as we go into the new year, the reality that Trump has genuinely lost will finally sink in, and as Biden becomes president, maybe Qanon can finally dissipate a little and if I'm lucky, my dad can finally cut it out. I know that's probably a fool's errand at this point, but I want the world to heal from everything that's happened this year, and I am not at all interested in humoring hateful conspiracy theories like Qanon that do nothing but make people feel negative and awful. I'm angry at Trump, Qanon, Fox News, all the social media platforms and providers that enabled Q, and to some extent, even my dad, but I want to believe that we will be better equipped in the future to nip things like this in the bud, and maybe I can even have my dad back. Things like this can't last forever, and I hope that as Trump disappears from the public spotlight, maybe Qanon will too.   \n",

friend (50sF) who is an outspoken Trump supporter. The first time I met her, she didn't know what Qanon was. Then I saw her this past weekend, and she told us she had started following Q. Right away she was telling us all about Q, the \"evidence\", the whole 9 yards. Any objection to her claims was met with \"that's what they want you to think\". Apparently, there was nothing whatsoever being done about human trafficking  until Trump was in office. The capitol riots? Fake, Antifa did it. If one of us started responding to what she was saying, she would immediately cut us off by speaking loudly over us. When I brought up Qanon and 4chan/8kun, she confidently said that Q and his true followers do not use either of those sites, only telegraph. Any Q stuff on 4chan/8kun is made up to make Q look bad. I had no idea how to even respond to any of this. I know there's no point in arguing and nothing anyone can really do. It's both frustrating and terrifying. Anyway, I'm still thinking of this encounter days later and just needed to vent.   \n",

                                                    My mother is very anti 5g and wont have anything to do with it, we moved to the country side to \"get away from the city killing centers\" that were supposedly using 5g to cull the population.  That didn't happen (big shock) and now I have a really hard time figuring out why she is so against it, but totally fine with previous generation cellular systems.\\n\\nWhenever I challenge her belief in this she just goes \"I know what it does to peoples bodies, its sick\" and if I question too much she just yells \"I know about this and you don't, don't argue with me, you know nothing\" so before I call my mother very nasty expiative, I just leave and avoid that heart ache. \\n\\nI was fine where we were living and she didn't even mention 5g for the last two years, until all of the internet providers for our area are switching their cellular plans to 5g.  for those who aren't in rural areas, we either have satellite or cellular (wireless) internet that used to run on LTE.  The sat internet is terrible, star link is great, and it looked like the 5g swap was going to improve our internet tonnes. \\n\\nanyways, because of the switch, we need new hardware and our telecom, Bell, issued us a notice that we need to update our receiver and if we don't, they will cancel our service. its supposed to go out in two days, so who knows if they will actually do it. \\n\\nI do not understand the fears of it, and plus, if we already have 5g coverage, it will mean nothing if we use it or not, same with star link, she got so upset when I told her I was going to order a set up.  \\n\\nto quote her when Covid first began and she would question if it was real \"WHERE ARE THE BODIES\" if 5g and the 'clot shot' are killing everyone, where are the massive piles of bodies everywhere? oh right, every death now is a result of 5g and the vaccine.  \\n\\nCurrently my folks are looking to get some awful small town ISP that charges an insane amount of money for terrible service all because '5g bad'. so frustrating.   \n",

                                                             To put my dad's addiction into perspective, he has one bumper sticker for where I went to school for my bachelor's degree (in Criminology, go figure), one bumper sticker for my sister's career, and two bumper stickers for Qanon. All he listens to all day long are far-right conspiracy theories on YouTube like Qanon, Pizzagate, the Clinton's, etc. and digs himself deeper and deeper. It's gotten to the point that I accept it about him and have no desire to help him to get out of the hole he's created. If he's happy down there then, it can put the lotion on its skin. However, he does say some things that get me so frustrated that I can think about them for days at a time, but this one has had me flustered for a few weeks now. \\n\\nAnyway, he said a few weeks ago that there is no possible way that Joe Biden can win. Literally a 0% chance. I'm pretty sure I've seen some other posts in here of this nature. If he DOES win, it will have only been because of dirty liberals and the criminal illegal immigrants that the Clinton's bussed into the country that are conspiring to commit voter fraud. He basically won't accept the results of the election. For the record, I'm a centerist and I haven't told him who I'm voting for; he has assumed that I'm voting for Biden even though I literally have not decided yet and in the end I don't really care who wins. He has asked me in the past to explain the left's ideals to him since he groups me with them and he just can't wrap his mind how stupid the democrats' idologies are and I actually do my research on their ideas to stay informed on both sides. I've been happy to talk about politics with him in the past considering my background in Criminology but, since Q started it's been Guantanamo Bay style torture to try to talk to this brick wall of a man. That being said, as far as I can tell (so far, obviously) Joe Biden is projected to win. \\n\\n[FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/)\\n\\nI'll be the first person to say that this projection could be complete ✨BS✨ and it could just be the media that I'm consuming that's creating a confirmation bias. Either way, I've been thinking about this fateful day in November if Joe wins for weeks. I'm positive it would be some kind of, \"Looks like the illegals came out to vote!\" type of badmouthing, as if this was some kind of sporting event instead of deciding on the next leader of our country. \\n\\nIf he would just educate himself on what voter fraud is, how it's checked for, how often it happens, how the prosecution/evidence in voter fraud cases works, which side of the political spectrum is more likely to commit voter fraud if either, etc. Basically if he did his due diligence as an American voter, we wouldn't be here. But I can't control him or force him to educate himself, especially since he won't listen to anything I send him research-wise anyway because the media is brainwashing me (/s). When in reality we all know that he's brainwashed himself. I've even tried to talk to my therapist about it and he said to realize that I have no control over what he thinks, which I have done my best to do. This is the only conversation that I haven't been able to get off my mind that has been kind of keeping me up at night. \\n\\n\\nWhat I'm trying to say is... Does anyone have an emotional plan for if their Qanon relative says something like this if this happens in November? Do you have anything planned to say? Does anyone have any advice on how they've worked through something like this with someone in their life before?\\n\\nTl;dr: My dad says the only way that Joe Biden can win is through voter fraud and I am unbelievably frustrated by that. I am scared for what he might say in November and I'd like to emotionally prepare. Advice?   \n",

Name a conspiracy theory and they'll be in on it. Let them run loose and you'll jump from microchips to new world order to the end times in moments. They've a long history of mistrust in institutions and science (for my whole life they've been creationist Christians), so I see qanon as a natural extension of that and therefore deeply wrapped up in their self identity and world view. Letting go of any of it would be too transformational at this point for them, because it would mean letting go off creationism etc and all the rest of it. I've had many conversations and tried to teach them how to critically evaluate sources etc over the years to precisely zero effect, and for my own peace, I've had to recognise I'm not responsible for them or their thoughts, and I can't change their mind.\\n\\nIncreasingly, I'm seeing articles online and in the media on how to constructively engage with your qanon, with the aim of reasoning/changing their minds. Whilst I'm glad the research and info exists, and I hope lots of people use it to good effect, when I read it I just feel...tired. And guilty. And like a failure for not succeeding in changing their minds after thirty years of trying. And like a bad child and person for not wanting to put any more energy into it, when I have my own busy life to live, and talking about it with them makes me sad and hate them.\\n\\nI suppose I was just curious if anyone else felt similar?! For those of you still trying, you absolutely have my deepest admiration and I genuinely think lots of people's mind can be changed! But I also think there's some, like my parents, who are so far off the deep end it's impossible - just wondering if this resonated, I suppose?!   \n",

into the trump propaganda since the beginning and its gotten much worse in the last year.  first she unfriended me on fb and now recently blocked me.  things were somewhat normal until this, i mean as normal as it can be given the polar opposite views we have.  She even sent birthday and Christmas gifts.  \\n\\nThis morning she left a strange vm saying there is a reason she had to block me, it was for my own protection, and that she is very worried about my physical safety in the upcoming months.  she also said she couldnt text about it, could only talk on the phone  wtf\\n\\ni texted my step dad saying i didn't appreciate her threatening me and to knock it off!  she texted me like 12 times saying i misinterpreted her vm and not to worry.  i blocked her and my step dad from calling or texting and told her so before i did.  she just said ok, love you!  wtaf??  \\n\\n\\nis anyone else experiencing this?  she also told me they drained their retirement funds because of whats going to happen this spring.  shes losing her goddamned mind   \n",

I felt he had gone off the deep-end and worried about his mental health.  I tried to talk to him, and to talk to my family about it, and nobody agreed with me.\\n\\nDuring all of it, I wanted to reach out to his wife.  I just didn't have a close relationship with her (he moved far away, and met her while he lived there.  I only see her maybe 1 or 2x a year).  But, I did worry about her, and if she felt safe. \\n\\nI had gotten into a few online arguments with my brother over his insane beliefs, but they never went well.  So, I have basically just cut off ties with him for the past 5 or 6 months.  It was a losing battle. \\n\\nAnyway, I was recently made aware that his wife served him divorce papers.  I've now known for 3 days, I know the brotherly thing to do would be to contact him, and make sure he's okay.  But after dealing with him from a distance and being fed up, I can only imagine what his poor wife was going through. \\n\\nSo, if my soon-to-be-former Sister-In-Law ever posts on here, I want you to know that you have some family across the country that supports you, and wishes you nothing but the best!  You're making the correct decision, and I am so sorry I wasn't more supportive for you while you were going through this.   \n",

The rabbit hole claimed another victim forever. My wife and I will be getting a divorce. Of course she has fallen down it forever. I tried to give her the best life I could. She didn't have to work so she had a ton of free time on her hands. We raised a son who is 21 and her relationship with him isn't the greatest. Her internet addiction only grew stronger when Trump became president. I guess I failed her by not intervening when she  started to become distant from me. Then Q came along. She vehemently denys the internet has anything to do with are brake up. I try to give her the benefit of the doubt constantly in my mined over and over. But in my best judgment it had alot, if not everything to do with are break up.I was faithful and worked to better our lives for the 27 years we where together. I understand people grow apart. She was so consumed by what she was reading \" on the internet \" she lost touch with the people closest to her (me). I did my best, most our marriage was great. Maybe I wasn't the man she needed me to be .However, all I do know is internet addiction is real.   \n",

I’m sorry I’m not sure this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but I’ve found no other active sub that would be better fitted. I desperately need to get this off my chest to people who would truly understand me, as it would seem like complete gibberish to those surrounding me. \\n\\nContext: Me and my soon to be ex husband (STBX) are from and live in the Middle East. We are fairly westernized, are completely fluent in English and have consumed Western/American pop culture since we were kids. \\n\\n\\nIn 2017, right after we married, he lost his job, turned on youtube for boredom, motivation and job-hunting tips and somehow ended up on Jordan Peterson’s channel. Cue days and nights of obsessive watching. Then he found Mark Dice, Lauren Southern, Steven Crowder, Ben Shapiro, Black Pigeon Speaks, and various “owning the libs/SJW are stupid” compilations, which ultimately led him to “JESSE PETERSON SAVAGE MOMENTS” compilations. For an idea of how fast this happened: in August 2017 we agreed that the Unite The Right rally was a terrible idea filled with terrible people and four months later in December 2017, he was showing me videos about the white “genocide” in South Africa and the big replacement in Europe. \\n\\n\\nAt first he was more obsessed with Jordan B. Peterson, so he was spending money on Jordan B. Peterson’s book of 12 rules of nonsense, buying his self authoring courses, buying his tshirts, then he started contributing to various patreons of questionable figures. \\n\\n\\nRight before the pandemic, he started watching Jesse Lee Peterson seriously. Since then, whatever frail good thing our marriage still had has been gone. JLP’s entire discourse is that women are crazy, evil by nature, controlling, as well as terrible opinions and advice about politics, the pandemic, vaccines, etc. My STBX regularly calls him on his show, and JLP responds with a spiritual word salad. \\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, my STBX’s opinions concerning the pandemic and vaccines are legitimately bullshit. 5G electromagnetic field heavy metals disturbing kind of bullshit. \\n\\n\\nI’m so tired of this! We’re separated but have a kid and I cannot believe I will have to parent this kid with him for the rest of our lives. He legit thinks I’m evil (like all women are by nature and a bit more on top) and want to deprive the kid of him as a father. The more he watches JLP, the more he’s convinced I’m evil, just a dumb woman whose views and opinions are useless, etc. And the more he becomes convinced that I’m going to hurt and mess up our kid and only sees my actions, thoughts, feelings through this fucked up lens. \\n\\n\\nI’m genuinely perplexed. Our political context is completely different. Our social context is different. The racial, feminist and LGBTQ issues that are present in the US manifest entirely differently here. There’s so much cognitive dissonance in what he believes, for e.g. he doesn’t believe in police brutality in the US, but he believes it happening here in our country. Plus, we live in the freakin Middle East for god’s sake. If he was so prone to being radicalized, wouldn’t it slightly make more sense if he was radicalized in a way that befits the culture/religion here? At least I’d have more help and resources to help him out of it. I’m heartbroken and confused. No one here understands what a word of all this alt-right whacko shit means. \\n\\n\\nWe’ve been separated for a month and are heading towards divorce. I can’t understand how someone so kind, funny, thoughtful, who was struggling with some personal issues turned into this paranoid delusional brute whose gibberish I can’t stand listening to. \\n\\n\\nRant over. Thank you for making it this far.   \n",

We had a woman come in with her husband. My wife was tattooing the wife but since he is scared of needles, the husband sat up front talking my ear off. It was insane QAnon nonsense about how Melania is really Princess Diana and Jennifer Lopez is playing Kamala. Therefore so many nutty ass conspiracies that i couldn't keep up. I couldn't take it. I gave this man facts with sources and video to prove his nonsense was wrong. I told him just to stop talking to me several times, but he just kept going. This wasn't the first time they had been there. He did the same when he was there before. \\nI felt like I had listened for an hour before I finally had enough. I told him to leave our shop. I told him he wasn't welcome back, and that he needed to get his head checked. I lost my cool.\\nHe hadn't been talking for ten minutes and I was losing my mind! I don't know how anybody puts up with their loved ones that are into this crap. I truly do feel for y'all. I can't imagine listening to that insanity all the time. I haven't got the patience for these people anymore. I hope this stuff is over soon   \n",

                             Like most other Q folks, he’s made his political beliefs his entire identity, and it’s almost always sure to come up in a conversation. He hates where he lives now because it’s a more liberal state (despite the fact that HE’s the one who wanted to move there almost two decades ago). \\n\\nHe’s always been the kind of person who HAS to be right—even when he’s so obviously wrong, he never admits it til way later, so it’s not surprising, but still disappointing. He gets frustrated with me for not believing what he believes, and ironically, that makes me a sheep. Which is weird, because frankly, there’s propaganda on both sides, and you’re a sheep if you identify too heavily with ANY of it, but I digress. He’s always praised me for having good judgment and critical thinking skills, but anytime I disagree with him, suddenly I can’t think for myself and I’m just following the masses and listening to mainstream media (even though I don’t get my news from there lmao) and reading the wrong things. I just think that beliefs are very individualistic and complex and it’s not fair to say “my truth is the ONLY truth” and I extend that courtesy even to them. Except when their “truth” infringes on the rights of others. \\n\\nLike, if you don’t wanna wear a mask, fine. But understand that businesses can turn you away for it, and don’t act like that’s shocking? They can also turn you away for not wearing shoes or a shirt. When I said that you have to wear clothes to go in a store, he was like, “no, you WANT to. Who doesn’t want to wear clothes?” That’s... how do you miss the point by that much? He talks about mainstream media, and how everyone is living in fear, but HE’S sensationalising every bit as much. “Now it’s one mask! And some people wear two! The other day I saw someone wearing two masks and a face shield! What’s next?! Masks don’t even work, they’ve proven it!” Which... all of that is people’s personal preference? You’re going to talk about how people have rights, but get angry when they choose differently than you? He’s like “it’s only a matter of time before they start making us get the vaccine for everything, they’ve already done it for travel!” So... who’s living in fear again? You’re not afraid of the virus, but you’re afraid of wearing masks because it’s damaging to your oxygen levels or whatever, and you’re afraid of getting the vaccine. Fear is normal. We’re all afraid, in different ways. It’s asinine how conservatives act like they’re exempt from fear just because they operate around it differently. \\n\\nLike, he wanted to compare “my body, my choice” for abortions to wearing masks. Hello???? Are you for serious right now?? No one is LEGALLY making you wear a mask. Stores are privately owned and have a RIGHT to turn you away, and he’ll agree with that and then complain about it in the next breath, like it’s some kind of persecution. Also, in what world is wearing a mask for 20 minutes, half hour while you go into a store equivalent to carrying a baby inside you for nine months, pushing it out and raising it for 18 years or knowing it exists out there somewhere with another family if you put it up for adoption?\\n\\nEven more infuriating, is I’ve been learning more about core beliefs and how they run your life. We’re all just operating on beliefs we formed when we were young, and oftentimes aren’t even aware of. Our brain LOVES to be right, which is why confirmation bias is a thing—your brain will often twist anything to fit your already existing narrative, especially if you don’t watch it and question it. I can’t be angry at people for falling victim to that in a society that doesn’t teach us about it and leverages it against us with constant propaganda. So I reach out after, and text like, “I understand it’s frustrating to you and that you just want what’s best for me, but you should be able to respect other people’s beliefs because things are more complex than you’re giving them credit for” basically (also because I’d seen him calling other relatives of his things like “liberal scum” and asking another relative how she even stands them, which is... very Christian™️ of him) and he said it’s not his truth or my truth but THE truth, and implies that he knew nothing at my age and everything he’s learned has been through age and experience, and that basically by my age he’d already been in the military and was married with a kid, which is such a stupid measure of like, experience and intelligence, which is, again, subjective and individualistic. So, what, someone who is never in the military or never gets married or has kids even well into adulthood is never going to know as much as someone who does? Ugh. \\n\\nI know most of this is all just.... typical Q shit, but sometimes it’s so frustrating, and I just need to vent. So, thank you if you read 😂   \n",

is what they want\" when referring to America. \"They'll get what they're asking for\", \"they had the chance to keep him out of office\", \"Americans are stupid for doing this\".\\n\\nBut it's not that easy, is it? Everyone here KNOWS it isn't that easy. Everyone here has someone in their life that they had to spend their vote on nullifying. \"Americans\" may have voted for Trump, but as of this post 67.3 million Americans were confirmed to have voted for Kamala. Those people aren't stupid, those people don't deserve it. Blue voters in red states aren't stupid and don't deserve it. Children who aren't even of age, whose \"safety\" was used as a platform who don't even agree, aren't stupid nor do they deserve it. Immigrants who pay American taxes yet aren't documented and can't vote aren't stupid or deserving.\\n\\n\"Americans\" are not just the ones that voted for the mango mussolini. There are millions of Americans who did their civil duty and tried to protect their fellow human. There are plenty of Americans who probably WOULD HAVE if they were allowed to.\\n\\nLet's not forget that this is a support group. We **cannot** point at each other and say \"you asked for this\", especially when we've done everything we legally could have done.\\n\\nAnd for those of you who are non-American, you ESPECIALLY cannot say that. Do not say that to me- don't you imply that I deserve what the future may bring when I voted and donated and spoke to everyone who wavered even the slightest bit. Don't you DARE imply my six year old sister little sister with a heart so big that she cries when complete strangers cry in her vicinity, or her schoolmates, or any of the other children too young to even know the dangers lurking ahead or the children who ARE old enough to know but not old enough to do anything about it deserve to grow up in the oncoming mess.    \n",

people have used to address a loved one's Q-related misinformation. My mom has gone from bad to worse with her misinformation & Q-beliefs, and Biden's announcement mandating vaccines for employees has her spiraling. She started sending me links to podcasts and articles that are just... wow. Really out there, totally nuts, completely removed from reality.  \\nI don't know how to respond appropriately. If I come back with hard facts & links of my own, she'll shut me out and plunge deeper down the Q-rabbit hole, which terrifies me. I'd like to remain empathetic & keep communication open, but help her understand that her sources are blatant misinformation. Any suggestions or success stories on how you've addressed a loved one's Q-beliefs or, without them feeling attacked or getting immediately defensive? I just feel so alone  in this.   \n",

She started last March with “covid will end us all- stay in the home” and ended kicking me out to live with my boyfriend. Then something snapped, in July she suddenly got DEEP into Q. She would send me texts talking about Hillary’s laptop and her eating people and anthony buordain getting high off of adrenochrome. Talking about how trump will be the end all be all, and discussing that feminism is a sham to oppress us. Discussing how Kamala harris was supposed to hurt Biden and take over as the communism queen. \\nAll of this, whilst emotionally abusing me. She was never a nice mom, undiagnosed BPD and many mental and mommy issues of her own. She treats me like fucking shit. I am terrified to block her because after trump losing , I’m scared she is going to kill herself. She was there for me when my real dad was not, and it is just terrifying to see. I think my step dad (who is into trump but not a Q die hard), may end up leaving her if she doesn’t stop. She will lose everything if he leaves. No one speaks to her anymore, she is a hermit. \\nHow do I help her ?   \n",

This is an environment that isolates children for radicalization, stockpiles rations and ammunition, and is prepared to shoot lots of people in a hypothetical societal collapse. And they're real excited about a collapse.\\n\\nThis is part 11 of my project reviewing all the darkness of this upbringing. I'm also running a volunteer project to talk with and help others recognize if they need to get out, or help someone out. If you want some help and advice for you or anyone you know personally, please read my aggregate post and PM me. I also answer questions there.\\n\\n[My Whole Brain is Fucked Up or: How to Escape the Accelerationist Militia that Raised You as a Child Soldier in Extreme Generational Poverty](https://redd.it/tea2vj)\\n___\\nNo one in my father's family radicalized him, I'm sure of it. For all of my grandfather's failings in his household, he was consistently on the right side of building a better society when presented with the most difficult of choices.\\n\\nMy father shared on a few occasions that in the 60's my grandfather somberly told the dinner table that he killed nearly 100 Germans on that day decades earlier. As a bombardier flying over the Mediterranean his squadron was able to square up with a surfacing German submarine lined up at a British naval vessel. In what the extended family has tried to research as possibly the first such occurrence in combat, my grandfather sunk it.\\n\\nI believe it was after this he transitioned into a navigator. Some time in a later engagement, he leaned over to pick up his pencil and shrapnel tore through his flying tin can over his head. When they came to land, much of the squadron was missing. The flight surgeon saw this Michigan kid's shell shock and wouldn't let him off the ground again. He took the downtime to get a degree, then his commission.\\n\\nThe colonel in time came around to telling me the story about that bombing run, but very differently. This would be May of 2007, a few years after we completed his transition to assisted living. He was riding the excitement of his youngest grandkids flying all the way across the country to see him. He had a completely different energy level in an environment that provided access to more nutrients than the orange juice he watered his Jack Daniels down with. At one point he started wheezing and laughing asking if we knew how many Nazis he killed and talked about the flight.\\n\\nHe also might have been playing it up a little bit feeling outnumbered. The hospitality arrangements were made by my aunt, his oldest of three. Her husband until his tragic passing legally represented communities and whole neighborhoods in petitions to HUD. Friends he had made in a Japanese neighborhood kept a room open in their assisted living community until the colonel was ready to move in.\\n\\nThis sounds like trouble, but my grandfather radically dropped sixty years of racism against the Japanese within weeks once they invited him to play hearts. The problem was he kept trying to impress upon his kids how wonderful it turns out they actually were. My aunt, who maintained close relationships with this neighborhood for decades was ***MORTIFIED*** after they spoke with a young staff member welcoming them back from a lunch date. He turned and quietly confided to everyone living on that floor: *\"You know, I always thought the Japanese were homely... but they're GORGEOUS!\"*.\\n\\nAnother time, lecturing my uncle who came to visit:  \\n\"The Japanese are actually a REALLY lovely people!\\n\\n...\\n\\n... except for Pearl Harbor\"\\n\\nHe gets no points for subtlety or still speaking with sweeping generalizations, but he was voicing aloud his realizations that this racism had gone unchallenged for 60 years and made sure his kids kept up. My uncle was a combat translator in some of the thickest shit in Vietnam, and probably still spoke at least one east-Asian language fluently. He was laughing so hard he was crying while trying to get his father to politely shut the fuck up in the hallway.\\n\\nAs soon as my grandfather got to flirt and play cards with them, he realized he loved his vices more than hate. Much like he became a Braves fan watching local broadcast in South Carolina, he had now become a Mariners fan. He went to nap in his chair more than once even in the brief time I was there waiting for the batting order to turn over to bring back up Ichiro.\\n\\nThere's more to the relationship my uncle and grandfather each had with east Asia. And it was real fucking good work. Let me share this by way of the two well-known reasons that my grandfather never made full-bird in his 35 years.\\n\\nThe first would be my uncle's charismatic fire in the early 60s. The USAF then more than they do now expected you to keep your family in order, especially as an officer. My uncle as a young teenager became good friends with the base commander's son. On a wild drunk, they took swings at some MPs trying to split them up and get them home. They must have known them by name and probably would have been happier with these kids' fathers not knowing theirs. As a transparent demonstration cracking down on this shit, my grandfather shipped my uncle off to military school. It was very much a \"you two don't have a brother anymore\" situation.\\n\\nThe second reason keeping him out of the brass would come several years after the first. My uncle was still enjoying all the same vices his father loved. Going hard, he lost a bet and subsequently enlisted in the marines. [I talk about this trauma and his strength here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowledgeFight/comments/tubulj/mwbifu_a_deep_dive_into_where_my_father_became/?). In this horrific time, my uncle and grandfather reconciled. The colonel requested transfer into Vietnam to substitute out his son. My uncle was quickly in front of congress as witness to American atrocities. It had been his responsibility to know these people and be able to talk with them in confidence.\\n\\nMy grandfather did field intelligence in east Asia years before. Once in Vietnam, he refused to be party to the system fudging statistics and hiding atrocities. His career ground to a halt, and he was out of the air force by '74. It's probably why he refused to be buried until 2010, to make sure he used that comfortable military pension to day drink, court widows, and watch baseball more than all his time in the service.\\n\\nFor all their personal faults and their shared history of violence, my uncle and his father took it upon themselves to be a team and do the right fucking thing against war criminals. No one in this family gave my father any real push into his radicalization as a right wing terrorist. The colonel may have provided instruction on domestic violence techniques, but not hate. Even after having his keys taken away due to his advanced age living in South Carolina, he saw my little brother and I play basketball with the black families living together down the street. He made sure he had a way to vote for a 2002 referendum to increase his property taxes to fund more schools.\\n\\nThis doesn't narrow things down much, but that radical is going to be one of the conspiracy-guzzling libertarians my father met in the 80's years before my time.\\n\\nWhen the colonel died, my uncle received the flag and spent rifle casing from the military funeral. My father wasn't happy, clearly narcissistic enough to believe he had any stake in the bond they formed speaking up for innocent life. The colonel had the steel to look a glad-handing spy in the eyes holding a gun to his heart and make them acknowledge both of their outfits would forgive him for shooting them. I wonder how easily the colonel was able to see through my father, if he was the kind to coward to be on the comfortable side when presented tough choices.   \n",

been interested in nonsense conspiracies and 'alternative facts' and has admittedly also always had a bit of a racist streak in him, but by and large he was pretty harmless and non offensive 95% of the time....that started changing pretty quickly though with Trumps big rise in the leadup to the 2016 election to now where he's completely gone off the deep end.  \\n\\n\\nHe pretty quickly became a full blown q convert and stopped going into work more and more often so he could spend more time watching youtube and talking to other fellow believers.   \\nThe arrival of covid really kicked it into high gear and he became more and more angry and outspoken with his views, culminating in him quitting work when vaccine mandates were introduced requiring him to be vaccinated to be able to carry on working.  \\n\\n\\nPretty soon after he went on a big road trip for a few months with the excuse of needing to just get away to clear his head and calm down a bit....he came back and though still a full blown believer was at least less vocal about it and seemingly spruiking less insane conspiracies...  \\nFast forward to this past weekend when i was catching up with him at a family dinner where he decided to share his newest interest with everyone - as usual, more q nonsense annnnnnd full blown neo nazi rallies  \\n\\n\\nAfter being politely told by my mum, my other (also far right supporting) older brother and I that we didnt want to watch or hear about any of that and following an unsuccessful attempt to get him to talk about some of his old non batshit hobbies he started ranting about jews, blacks, race traitors and pedophile elites and stormed out on us.   \\n\\n\\nIts been a few days but i still feel shocked and depressed as it seems he's now well and truly too far

                                                              Hi everyone,\\n\\nI feel a mixture of guilt and satisfaction over this event. . .  This post will be long but I need to write this as a form of catharsis for myself. \\n\\nI am a longtime lurker of this sub as I’ve been watching family on all sides go down the Christian nationalist/fascist path. . . I was raised liberal but have always been surrounded by conservatives, being from Texas but always living in cities. My husband is from East TX and he is the only liberal in his entire family. He escaped East Texas, which he calls “the land that time forgot”, went to college, and we met. We’ve been together for 9 years and married for 7. We are a normal couple. We are liberal af. I love him so fucking much. \\n\\nI’ve always gotten along with my husband’s family because they reminded me of my own large, crazy family growing up. As I get older I realize this is nothing to idolize but alas, psychology. \\n\\nI’ve made every effort to show kindness and love towards my husband’s family and to bond with them since I met them. I actually love(ed) them very much. He is one of 8 and I quickly became beloved by the younger teenagers and kids especially, throughout the extended family. For example, my husband’s younger sister came out to me as a lesbian MONTHS before she ever told anyone else— and when she did, she was promptly banned from the family. She actually moved in with me and my husband for 6 months rent free while she got on her feet. A few years later, my husband’s 14 yr old niece came out to me as well. I have been that safe person for the young ones growing up in that shitty family system. \\n\\nI also host the kids every year at my family bay house for a week as well as let her s teenage brother come over for ~1 month by himself every summer to get away from his crazy family. I’m saying all of this because I want y’all to understand how hard I’ve tried.\\n\\nThere have been a few political squabbles in the family over the 9 years I’ve been with my husband and I am not totally innocent in that regard. My husband will ALWAYS, without fail, be antagonized for being liberal at one point or another during our visits to East TX (5-6x/year). For example, for all four years of Trump’s presidency, my husbands mother gifted trump gold coins to him at Christmas. 4x. She is a horribly abusive woman— physically, emotionally, financially, the whole gambit. She is a classic evil family matriarch— the source of all the dysfunction and someone who tears the family apart rather than bringing it together. She wouldn’t even shake my hand the first time she met me. Just because. She’s also told me I’ll be a bad mother. I could keep going. She’s honestly always been so over the top insane that it’s been easy for me to write her off. \\n\\nSome of the older siblings take after her with their QAnon type beliefs but generally we just grin and bear their one or two insane comments at the whatever gathering it is. For example, his mother and oldest sister are nurses (I am too) and they love to say that they have multiple patients who died from the Covid vaccine. Our way of handling this has been to ignore it, change the subject, make a joke. For the sake of the family. We never, ever bring up anything political. \\n\\nAnd I’ve never said a thing to her or any other his siblings who take after her, except for a couple clever retorts here or there on the bullshit articles they would post on Facebook, or a dirty look while they poke at my husband.\\n\\nSo yeah. In April this year, my mother was diagnosed with aggressive stage IV breast cancer. This was obviously completely devastating news. My mom is under 65, healthy as a horse (weight, bloodwork, exercise etc) and has had clear mammograms, including her most recent. It’s an insanely aggressive cancer and this summer has been so hard. I’m the eldest and I’ve been her caretaker. Her prognosis is decent but cancer is a rollercoaster. We are doing the best we can. \\n\\nThe younger sister that lived with us had a baby shower a couple months ago. When she broke up with her girlfriend, she immediately got knocked up by a man, had a shotgun wedding, and was promptly welcomed back into the family. I could not bring myself to go to this shower because I had just found out about my mom. \\n\\nMy husband went and when he got home, I asked what his family said about the news. I fully expected a sympathetic and supportive response from them bc our relationship with all the siblings was so strong. Like, the two youngest had just spent a week and a half at our house near the gulf. \\n\\nInstead, my husband told me that both his oldest sister and his mother immediately said that it was probably because my mom took the vaccine and uses 5G. They have met my mother as she hosted them in her home several times.\\n\\nI felt numb for a few days because it was just so silly. But then something in me just snapped and I sent his older sister a very mean text. \\n\\nI said “my mother has graciously hosted you in her home. a vile hag like you doesn’t deserve to even look twice at someone like my mother. Enjoy rotting away in that shithole you call home. Get fucked.”  \\n\\nI sent the text to her directly but she then forwarded it to the whole family and acted like she had no idea what it was about. Everyone rallied to her side including those who I’ve helped so drastically in the past. The family is firmly united in hatred for me now. \\n\\nMy husband didn’t try to stop me or ask me to change what I said. He’s been very supportive but I can tell that my new-found vitriol for his family is starting to make him uncomfortable. I know he’s disgusted with them as well, but of course he can’t match my new, and very pure, hate.\\n\\nIt’s been a couple of months and I just can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve never hated someone so much or been so disgusted. . I fully plan on never speaking to any of them again, excluding the teenage brother who said he understood why I said what I said. \\n\\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to handle this going forward? When I inevitably see them again? And how to deal with this with my husband?\\n\\nIf you made it this far, I salute you.\\n\\nFuck all these brain -rotted freaks.\\n\\nEdited for grammar   \n",

*SIGNIFICANTLY* with my mental health towards my Qasualty. Long story short, she helped me through my darkest time yet while I was caring for my dying grandma and my family seemingly dropping (almost) everything on my shoulders. So, when she got deep depp *deep* into Q because of the Save The Children thing, it hurt.\\n\\nShe and I bonded over our shared hobby of the occult. I'm the kind of guy that *loves* history and the occult is just an extension of that. Seeing christianity it it's proto forms from the Jewish religion and gnosticism, even the pagan stuff that got pulled in later on. However, she actually saw me as an expert in the occult. She said that to me, specifically. \\n\\nI've said it before on here, I'm just a guy who wrote a fiction novel involving that stuff. So, when she got deep into this, my love for writing fictional stories around real folklore got soured. So, I turned to an idea I'd had before, but didn't give enough time until now.\\n\\nExplore the supernatural through the lens of mental health! The idea is sound; mental disorders that would cause people to believe they're werewolves or vampires. Sleep paralysis and walking visual and auditory hallucinations when you're half asleep causing you to see ghosts. Schizophrenia, mass hysteria, gaslighting from narcissists. Hell, let's throw drugs and alcohol into the mix! Go full Bender Bending Rodriguez and toss some blackjack and hookers in too!\\n\\nAll of that excitement I just put into that paragraph above? It dies down when I think, for even a single second, if I should make my A Plot the *actual* QAnon or make a fictional, thinly veiled parallel. Like some CW's Supergirl equivalent that can also be hokey and overly ridiculous. Or, should I go full force and show just how destructive, hurtful and outright dangerous the real QAnon really is?\\n\\nI've already decided to study it like I do the occult. Like I said above, it's my love of history and if Q isn't going to be a significant moment in history, then idk what will. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think?   \n",

used to be normal, not taken to conspiracy theories. She done quite well in life and is wealthy, and when I was young, I would stay with her through the summer.\\n\\nI was from a low income, dysfunctional family growing up, so staying with her gave me a bit of normality and stability.\\n\\nAt the start of the pandemic, she started spamming me on WhatsApp with things about COVID-19 being a hoax and it’s snowballed from there.\\n\\nI haven’t spoken to her in a few months, so I decided to call her today. She has now become fully unhinged, talking about Prince Philip dying months ago, Joe Biden dying last year, the Queen being a paedophile, the banks are about to crash etc...\\n\\nI tried telling her not to believe everything she reads on the internet, or receiving via messenger from her new crank friends but she became quite irate with me for ‘not opening my eyes to what was going on’.\\n\\nDuring the call which was pretty much a 30 minute, one-sided tirade, she never once asked about myself or my children or my ailing elderly father (her brother). This is very, very unusual for her, it’s like she has become infected with a mind virus!!! Even more alarming is the fact a couple of her old time friends from when she lived in London have started to believe this crap, one of them was a high up staff member in the House of Commons!\\n\\nJust as I’m finishing typing this out, my WhatsApp is getting spammed, even though I don’t reply.\\n\\nGlad to feel like I’m not alone here.\\n\\n[WhatsApp screenshot](https://imgur.com/gallery/cKxvt4q)\\n\\n[More stuff whilst writing this post](https://imgur.com/gallery/eizyZ5i) \\n\\nEDIT TO ADD:\\nI’m not trying to trash my Aunt or make it appear I’m taking the piss out of her (I shouldn’t have named my Imgur post as ‘Crazy Aunt’).\\nShe was very good to me whilst growing up and I’m just worried about her.   \n",

She’s an extremely hard working woman who raised me and my brother herself while becoming a senior executive at one of the top 3 largest banks in the country- which wasn’t easy for a woman in the early 90s. I love my mother very much, and while my brother has given up trying to get her out of this Trump Cult I cannot just give up. No matter the facts I show, the logical fallacies I point out, similar to you’ll here - nothing works. However I would like help with this part. My mother was radicalized during Covid (like many others) and then volunteered to work on the cyber ninjas audit. She swears up and down she and my other family members that volunteered saw absolute fraud. Absolute in their mind. When I say things like “ok mom , so you guys saw this fraud and - what kept it a secret t??? Why did the cyber ninjas not tell us all about it” she says it’s because people were afraid. … she says things like “If we identified over 200,000 bad ballots here during the audit and other states are showing the same fraud, what conclusion should I come to?”\\nIn her mind the “perfectly filled bubbles” and “wrong paper “ mean it was some sort of amazing incredible fraud…. When I bring up the 92 page report wherein maricopa county refuted every single one of their bogus claims- she says they are “in on it” …. I don’t know how to say nicely- u didn’t know what the fuck u saw. I love my mom and I want her back. We don’t talk about anything other than trump and this pyschotic fraud claim. Every day, non stop. Not my kids, not my business, nothing but this whacko shit.  She keeps telling me I have “TDS” even though I’m a lifelong Republican , I have no idea why she thinks I would hate him just to hate him. It’s like he’s programmed his followers that if anyone says anything negative to immediately say TDS and shut them off. I’m really  afraid.   \n",

me. No matter who I was, I believed he'd love me regardless. I remember an incident when a family member told me that I was an embarrassment to the family because I “voted for a socialist” and my Uncle called him and said, “if you ever say anything like that to my niece again, you'll have me to answer to.” \\n\\nHe never talked about politics. I didn't even know he liked Trump. For 20+ years of my existence, he kept that part of himself separate from our relationship. Until the pandemic hit. That's when he started down the rabbit hole. I didn't know what QAnon was until May of last year when my Uncle posted the plandemic video. \\n\\nMy mother, who is a nurse and deals with COVID-19 a lot, and I tried to reason with him. If not for himself, then for my grandparents who are well into their 70s and both have health issues. He couldn't be reasoned with. He refused to wear the mask. He told us to “do our own research and we'll see.” \\n\\nOf course, in May / June of last year, the Black Lives Matter protests also started. I remember posting about the police brutality on Facebook and my Uncle responded with a comment, calling me a “butthurt leftist.” I told him to back-off and he told me to start caring about “the eight million children that go missing every year” instead of BLM and Antifa. \\n\\nI unfriended him on Facebook, thinking that'd be the end of it. He called me back-to-back three times and I didn't answer. He texted me, “You put a major wedge between us. When it's clear, you will owe me a MAJOR I'm-fucking-sorry-for-everything. I can't believe what you're about now. I'm ashamed to call you my niece. When will you all arm up and get rid of us?” \\n\\nHe also left a voicemail where he said “This is the last time you and I are probably ever gonna talk cus I never want to talk to you again. Don't consider me your Uncle. Go ahead and write me off.” \\n\\nI loved this man more than my own father. When I came out, he embraced me when others wouldn't. He told me he loved me unconditionally. I go to therapy and I try to work through it, but I don't know if I can forgive him for tossing me aside the way he did. It felt effortless, like I never really mattered.   \\n\\nI know that was a lot to read through. I appreciate every person who has posted here. I'm both sad and comforted by the fact that I'm not alone. I hope all of you have some success in bringing your loved ones back. And thank you for letting me tell my story.   \n",

                                                   My mom was an antivaxxer long before facebook existed. It led to her choosing not to have me vaccinated *ever.* I'd get dragged to antivax rallies at the capitol and had to see doctors to get medical exemptions filled out. It wasn't as much of a social issue pre-COVID, but now......it's hell. I'm living with my parents and brother while I finish my degree, and she makes everyone in the house take ivermectin (the horse version) and hoards hundreds of types of vitamins. I *want* to get vaccinated for COVID, but she would lose her mind. My high-risk dad got Pfizer in early March and had a bad allergic reaction (which is a valid concern for me as well, but the risk of having a reaction is necessary to exist in the outside world now). My mom *lost her mind.* She saw my dad getting the shot as a betrayal of her trust and diminished her power in the household. I had to write a religious exemption letter for my fucking college because I'm terrified of what she might do if I got the shot independently.\\n\\nThe last two years have been bad, but it got worse when the world started opening back up again. It's been really difficult to see my friends going out and doing things and I'm stuck at home with my abusive qmom. Bad combination for a severely depressed extrovert. Lotta alcohol and a lot of spiraling. Hell, I'm trying to make plans for a birthday dinner with my aunts and my mom is forcing me to change them because of a contact tracing guideline she read for SCHOOLS. Something that's not relevant to restaurants with outdoor seating on a *Monday night*. I'm just......so tired. Tired, frustrated, angry, desolate. I just want to interact with the outside world again.\\n\\nEDIT: First, please don't tell me how easy it is to get vaccinated and that I should just go do it. I can't do so until I'm out of the house, away from my mom, and have the financial stability to risk getting really fucking sick. i have no idea how my body will react to any vaccination. Second, she has control over too many aspects of my life and I don't want to think about what would happen if she found out while I was living at home. I'm 22, but I can't drive and she tracks all my internet history.   \n",

this a thing now on fox? I spoke with my mother in rural Pennsylvania yesterday. She was talking about how she and her husband went to a little local restaurant. She said that as they were leaving a bus pulled up and all these Chinese men got off. She said that now there are all these Chinese men coming over the border and they have cell phones and they wear suits and they are pulling rolling suitcases, and they look like business men going to a job, and then they get added to all these buses of illegals being shipped all around the rural area where she lives. then she said right after that there was a bus load of Hondurans. \\n\\nWait I said. Chinese immigrants? I haven’t heard that we’re getting a bunch of immigrants from China. She said they’re coming over the border! And I said, what border? China is on the other side of the planet. (as we learned from cartoons, it’s straight down when you dig.) And she said they’re coming over the Mexican border and I said why are they coming over the Mexican border and she said ask Biden. I don’t think I have the energy to watch Fox News but they must suddenly be on about Chinese people because that’s the only place she gets this. For a long time she has been saying that there are these white buses with no windows that come out of nearby small towns, late at night, and then all the local small towns just have these people dumped there. And they stay in the hotels and they get free healthcare and they get free cash and some of them get free cars and they don’t have to get vaccines and none of them speak English, and the men are rude when you meet them on the sidewalk.\\n\\nIt’s a lot I know. She complains that she sees them (first Mexicans, most recently Africans) at Costco and they’re buying up all the meat and I’m thinking but it’s a store. It is literally there to sell food.   \n",

days with no sign of improvement. She's pretty much bedridden. Yesterday I (F47) suggested she request steroids from a doctor, to stave off any inflammation that may be setting in. My Q brother (M35) convinced her to call one of those Frontline doctors and get ivermectin instead, which she did. That doctor also gave her a prescription for antibiotics, with the assumption there is an underlying infection. I'm not necessarily convinced she has an infection at this point, but they probably can't hurt. Q bro and my extreme healthnut sister (F45) are still going on about the dangers of modern medicine, telling her to trust her body and not take the antibiotics, and are singing ivermectin praises. Maybe ivermectin would have worked if she'd started it on day 2 or 3, but everything I can read about it online suggests it's probably too late at this point. The fact she is choosing that over steroids is freaking me out. I hate that she let herself get into this position by not getting vaccinated or social distancing. \\n\\n Exact quote from my brother today in the family group chat: \"Since when did we start agreeing or trusting the medical establishment?\" How about when our sister is clearly suffering from a preventable illness? He and another brother (M43) have spent the last year ranting about population control and how the media is lying about Covid, telling me I've been brainwashed by watching the news. It should be obvious who the brainwashed ones are at this point!\\n\\nThey also tried to talk my parents out of getting vaccinated, which luckily didn't work. My mom (F68), dad (M72), youngest sister (F31), and BIL (M26) all received the J&J today. I hope it's not too late. They live in Florida and are anti-maskers so it will be two weeks before I feel I can stop worrying about them.\\n\\nI have seven siblings, who I've been close with all my life. Until Trump and the pandemic, we were mostly on the same page politically, with only our parents being what is considered conservative. My sister (the one with Covid) went from discussing with me who she would vote for in the Democrat primaries in early 2016, to voting for Trump in November of that year, based solely on his stance on vaccines. I just can't get past the irony.   \n",

Q kids and many people locked relationship with these people.  This thing makes me laugh because if I had to close relationships with these people here in Italy I would no longer have friends except a dozen.\\n\\n(Sorry for the English)   \n",

I feel bad for my husband because he has become so angry, miserable, and isolated.  He can't even talk to random people anymore without bringing up the economy,  covid, or whatever. He's not a bad father, but I'm worried if I leave he will only get worse.  I want all the time in the world with my kids so it's hard to even say I'd do 50/50 custody, but I feel it's the right thing to do, but nervous I'll regret it the further he goes down the hole. I hesitate to even leave because I want to protect my kids at all costs, but i don't want them growing up thinking our relationship is normal. Any recently divorced folks on here with kids?   \n",

once before when I was desperately upset as my best friend has got so lost in this QAnon world and I'm not sure I made a whole lot of sense. \\n\\nReading posts here, it upsets me so much as so many are from teenagers who fear actual rejection from their families for taking care of their own health by getting vaccinated. Could I ask, do people here feel that QAnon supporters have a general element of psychological disturbance? My best friend had always had little elements of conspiracy theory leanings. and I feel horribly guilty that I didn't pay more attention to this. She has had a horrible insecure upbringing and lost her mother when she was in her twenties and I get the impression QAnon gives her a purpose and this weird energy for life. What do people here feel attracts someone to become part of something so utterly dreadful?   \n",

thread about my son. Well, the apple doesn't fall far, that's for sure. I've found that my sister sees people who are dead, and hears voices that aren't there. I've chalked it up to drinking in the past, and she is a VERY emotional person. But lately she's been quoting Q stuff in our family chat on FB, and I can't. I just can't. I had pretty successfully stopped telling her it's all crap, until the day before yesterday, when I decided to share Biden's speech about getting the vaccine and masking, etc. in the family chat, because they - all of them in my family - are trump supporters and anti-vaxxers and I felt called to share truth.   \\n\\n\\nAs usual, my older sister (the crazy one), referred to trusting in God to keep her from harm. I also am a believe and trust God for many things, but I really don't believe God means for us to turn our backs on His provision of vaccines, as well as all our food etc. They eat the food gladly - and their deteriorating health shows it - but vaccines they've decided are from the devil \"libertards\", which they call me when I'm not in the chat. The other day, my older sister starting quoting more Q at me. She often sends the stuff to me unsolicited when I'm innocently  minding my own business. We have had a pact for a long time not to send each other stuff. So that's why I decided to send Biden. I guess it was wrong of me, but she broke the rule multiple times lately with no response from me. She quotes scripture to support the madness, and how all sorts of nutsy things are about to happen according to her favorite website, and how the things now happening to stop trump or his followers are all evil and from the devil and going to bring the Second Coming. Well, my younger sister got into it with me the other day for my measured words attempting to debunk their sheiss. I didn't want to get all argumentative at them, but they revealed how they talk about me in the family, which is like I'm a black sheep and brain washed and following lies etc. etc. etc. So their adult kids have their point of view. Since I've avoided arguing I haven't been able to show them the truth. My older sister refuses to get the vaccine and her mentally challenged husband as well, even though they are caretakers for our mother who is 92 and has heart failure, and very much would get the vaccine if it wouldn't kill her. At least our mom avoids people already anyway, but my sister and husband go out to church meetings and don't mask and don't distance, and none of those people believe in the vaccine, and they all seem to believe in the Q sheiss.   \\n\\n\\nAnd I'm wasting so very much time dealing with my feelings of being misrepresented and even ostracized in some ways by this family that used to be known for its love, I just can't stand it. I'd be advised by a therapist, most likely, to just walk away. I wish I could. I should probably just get yet another facebook page without my family in it, but they follow me and it's really hard to not accept them as friends because normally they ARE so loving and kind. It's this whole stupid political thing and Q that have them all blindly running as fast as they can over the cliff! Well, this is just a lot of venting, I guess. I wish I were one of those higher life forms that can just shake it off and forget it. But I'm not. I need a family. :'(  Sorry to ramble so much. And now I have to go. I have an appointment. Have a good day, and good luck to you all!   \n",

thabnks everyone on this sub. \\n\\ni have lost the light of my life, someone i though of very highly and was even swayed to postpone my vaccination (she managed to persuade me that it is unknown whether it is a risk to our planned pregnancy)... fast forward our struggles over a few months - she did get pregnant, but with the local qanon leader instead of me. i did get vaccinated before i found that out, but yeah. she lost her job (she was an anaesthesiologist) but she will keep the kid to raise it by herself...i pity that child already.\\n\\nfinding this subreddit helped me a lot to get over the personal crisis of loss of the family i had planned and imagined i already have. it is hard to explain that i have already heard children laughter and imagined them on my shoulders, and that i am left behind by someone who was brainwashed into a qult...but again, this sub helped a lot - hearing about everyone's experiences and all. thank you all again for sharing your truth, pain, and showing empathy for our losses to make grieving easier.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My Mother recently sold our family home and wanted one last Christmas together as a family in the house we grew up in. This includes me (33f) and my sibling (37m) and our own families (my husband, sister in law and three kids). \\n\\nMy sibling has been going down the alt right path for a while now. I haven’t been close to him since we were children, but every time we would speak on the phone, it would be the same thing (wanting to talk about conspiracy theories, rejecting vaccines, calling me and my husband lefty scum) ya know, normal stuff.  Regardless, I agreed to go to Christmas dinner, for the sake of my Mother. \\n\\nSo, here is where it gets worse. Sibling has now got a swastika tattoo right next to a Totenkopf, displayed on the inside of his arm. He kept sitting in a position where he would lift his arm behind his head, to pretend he was relaxing or whatever. He then pulled out a MAGA hat (we live in Australia..). \\nHe absolutely knew what he was doing. He didn’t verbally say anything, but he was deliberately provoking us with everything he was doing. Needless to say, we left with our kid, before dinner started. My Mother called me crying and blaming us for overreacting and told us to “just not look at them”. \\n\\nI’m feeling very sad and mentally exhausted from this entire thing. I have this sinking feeling and I keep bursting into tears, but I will absolutely not be in the same room as this person again. I will not sit at the table and play happy family with a Nazi. I will not teach my child that this is what we do. \\n\\nSo friends, here is me from the future with some wisdom. Don’t go to that Christmas lunch/dinner if you don’t want to. Your happiness is worth more than someone’s feelings. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR - Sibling is now a neo nazi and I “ruined Christmas” for leaving once I noticed the tattoos. \\n   \n",

My mom also invested in a coin called doge token. She lost 75% of what was put in. I advised her against putting money in but she listened to her telegram group instead. Luckily she only list 75$ but that could have been thousands. \\nThey also believe in the lizard people.   \n",

title - I mean he sends me his stuff here and there but it's lessening to maybe one thing a week ... he has accepted I am not blindly in agreement like his siblings who are both nuts. Thinf is Dad is smart, analytical, critical thinking. But he's been lost to sites like radio patriot and q drops... Alex Jones, amongst many more. \\n\\nI've caught no flagrantly bigoted vibes. Just the conspiracies about blm and obviously we all know, Obama eats babies or whatever... but not like cart blanc hate for a group ethnically etc. \\n\\nSo I can't help believe he's going to emerge?\\n\\nHe used to be my best friend. Best grandfather to my kids. Spend 50 percent of his time at our home, he even has a room (guest room but his stuff in the closet).\\n\\nBut he hasn't called me in a month and a half. He answers my call maybe half the time. And always is brief because some new news  is breaking. \\n\\nTell me these people get bored and come back. \\nTell me he snaps out of it and we laugh about this?\\nTell me he realizes how ridiculous this all is?   \n",

wanted to get it out somewhere where folks might understand. Just feel really alone about all this. \\n\\nSo, my (21) mom (60F) has always been something of a conspiracy theorist, ever since I was a wee thing. It went hand in hand with all her weird spiritual, new age stuff. She keeps on trying to talk to me about this conspiracy/Qanon shit and I just shut down. Mhm. Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. Huh. Because I used to engage, and in the end her opinions would make me so upset that I'd usually end up, uhh, crying. (Hey, I was a hormonal teen, and I've always sort of been a crybaby in the first place. Plus, finding out your mom is a trump supporter when you are openly gay can kind of be a lot.) My actual opinions would scare her a little, since I'm pretty far left. So I just barely react. Let her go on and on. And because of this, she thinks we've got some kind of fuckin...rapport. Since I don't shut her down like dad does. Like oh you're so good at listening, oh you're so good to talk to about this. And she's doing it more and more often lately. \\n\\nI feel like I'm a support system for someone I don't support. It fucking sucks. But she's my mom, and she's a good person deep down for the most part, just gullible as shit (long history of being in mlms and getting into cult shit), so I don't want to hurt her feelings by biting back. When I told her I felt like I couldn't trust anything she says because she gets all her info from disreputable places, and that some of the things she says really scare me, she started crying. And it's like, man! I don't wanna make my mom *cry!* It's just...ugh. What I wouldn't give for her to not be into this shit. \\n\\nI guess I'm also worried about her relationship with dad. I feel like all this is really putting a rift in their marriage. He gracefully put up with her spending hundreds on classes to hone her ✨empath✨ abilities and talking about bigfoot being an invisible extradimensional hyperintelligent alien at war with *other*, similarly alien bigfoots (bigfeet?), and all that bullshit, but he gets downright nasty whenever she brings up politics now and it results in a lot of cold shoulders and mutual hurt. But honestly, I'm jealous of him. Wish I could speak my truth like that, y'know?   \n",

being spouted over and over again is that the \"real\" Damar Hamlin is actually dead and the one we're seeing on TV is his double.  My wife has a friend that we are both afraid is starting to fall down the Q rabbit hole and the friend brought this up to my wife in a conversation last night.  She also told my wife that Hamlin wore some article of clothing at the Super Bowl last night that was \"demonic\" and \"Satanic.\" I told my wife most of this BS is just a repeat of the Satanic Panic of the 80's all over again.\\n\\nIs anyone else seeing or hearing any of this about Hamlin on social media or from any Q adjacent people in your lives?   \n",

before about my Qs. I met up at a park this weekend with them and my children. My SO, teenagers, and I have all been vaxxed. Apparently while I was walking back to my vehicle to grab something, a random man started telling my teens that all vaxxed people will be dead in the fourth wave that's coming. \\nMy Q also mentioned that \"they haven't changed a thing this entire year and are fine.\" \\n\\nMeanwhile, I caught Covid, my SO was stuck at work with a horrific outbreak, and my kids gave up everything this year because they were thinking about other people.\\n\\nI'm so exhausted from the mental gymnastics. I believe vaccines work, but when I'm constantly bombarded with people spewing about death from vaccines all day, it really wears a person out. I'm so tired of the doom and gloom, when in reality, there's never been a better time to be alive. We have such a good standard of living and we have access to life saving everything. I guess I'm just looking for a place to get this off my chest. I know many of us are in the same situation.   \n",

My husband and I have been married for 38 years, and never has there been such a chasm between us.  He spend hours \"researching\" and talks endlessly about all he knows.  Typically, something huge is about to happen that will change the world, the way we know it.  Since the election is over, now, his main topic is the collapse of the dollar, the end of the IRS, and how we need to be prepared. He's asked me not to share details, \"because it could put our lives and our loved one's lives in danger\".  I have been very vocal that I think all these ideas are garbage and last week used the word \"delusional\".  He is now angry with me \"I've supported you all these years. \\[I have chronic fatigue, and rest a lot\\].  All I'm asking is that you show me the same respect.  You haven't even taken the time to do the research, but you would rather take the word of others than to research it yourself, and come to the same conclusions as me\".  When I ask him about the source of his research, he said he cross references what he learns with news articles in foreign newspapers that confirms the validity of what he's reading.  Am I wrong to not try to \"research\" all this stuff?  I just have a very strong aversion to all of it, starting with Trump.   \n",

posts daily shit that just sounds like the same thing over and over... innerstanding is said a lot...  I can't know for sure that my mom believes in every word that is said in this telegram thread... but I am unintentionally becoming resentful that shed become so invested in something so stupid when my home growing up was VERY atheist. \\n\\nToday's post from \"The Seed Movement\"\\n\\n\"The deep dive of truth also brings you to an innerstanding of who you truly are. Why you came here in this lifetime and the seed mission that you carry in your heart created in God and Christ Consciousness can be rediscovered. You just have to say “Yes”\"   \n",

          My elderly Qanon mom is visiting for a few days. This morning was mostly quite however there was a couple of bigoted rants, her usually focus on sex crimes toward children and a new one - “evil” Lady GaGa and her force field. I looked at the video footage and it looks like a cloth was thrown on stage. It stopped flap as if it hit a plastic barrier. I told my mom this but she’s convinced it’s sorcery and that the Illuminati gave Lady GaGa special powers. It makes sense to me that there would be a barrier between the audience and the stage for the preformers safety and confidence. It would also make sense to me to see a hologram of the performer during a “live” performance as audience people are nuts these days. My mom said it’s a “force field” because that’s what the article tells her. What happened to common sense?   \n",

ramble, but I just needed to get these thoughts out somehow. \\n\\nI have been struggling with protecting my mental health and creating boundaries with my q-adjacent, right wing, pro-ivermectin anti-Covid vaccine family for a long time, but I am now reaching a point of exhaustion. \\n\\nMy unvaccinated family continue to plan and host large gatherings (I.e., engagement parties, Xmas parties, an upcoming wedding, etc), and I have no idea how to respond to “invitations” to these unvaxxed Covid parties when they arrive. I’m not as concerned for myself if I were to attend, since I’m fully vaxxed, but I wouldn’t be comfortable going knowing I could potentially play a part in transmitting covid to my unvaxxed family members, especially the older people like my grandparents. \\n\\nDespite everything, I still love them, and I’m sad that I don’t have a way of maintaining these family relationships or attending events without actively endangering their health. Many of them, including my mother, also have no verbal boundaries and refuse to talk about anything other than the vaccine/ivermectin/the conspiracy of the day. My mom in particular seems to enjoy ignoring/running over my boundaries. \\n\\nI know that their choices have led to this situation, but I still feel shitty for ignoring/declining every single invitation. Some of my more normal cousins (who are vaccinated) still attend, I think to help them maintain some internal feeling of normalcy, so I end up feeling like I’m being unreasonable or overly cautious by avoiding these events. When I try to communicate my boundaries and my concern for the antivaxxers’ health, I’m shut down and basically told that I’ve been brainwashed. \\n\\nHow do you cope with the recklessness and stupidity of it all? Do you just turn down invitations like this without explanation to avoid conflict, or would you bother to explain why you’re not comfortable attending? \\n\\nAlso, thank you for this community. I’ve been reading your posts for a long time, and they have really made me feel less alone.   \n",

No one told me till last minute (he’d had it for week?) and then my brother *texted* me that he died as I was walking into an elevator running errands. I am the only non-Q in family at this point. Rest of my story is elsewhere, but you can imagine my persona non grata status. I had just gotten to a good place with the lack of funeral and closure, then BAM! here comes the text last night…there is going to be a funeral. At a military cemetery. My Dad didn’t even care about his short time in the military and was a conscientious objector. He went for the electronics training and to avoid rumors of the upcoming Vietnam draft (if you enlist I guess you have more job options). He did have a penchant for conspiracy theories my entire life and was no doubt stocking up on ivermectin. \\n\\nAaannddd cue the crazy … now everyone treating this like he was a bible thumping war hero except no one seems to know his rank, years of service, honors, stories, favorite verses, etc for the funeral. I DO know all those things and appear to be the only one. Even my husband knows and my own older brothers don’t. I literally never saw my Dad reading the bible my whole life. He definitely believed in God but hated church. He did like those bible conspiracy books written by self-published pastors from Nowhere, USA stocking their bunkers for the End Times. \\n\\nSo I guess I’m going to be leaning on you guys for the next month again. Ugh things were going so well. Now I regret telling the universe I needed closure even after she whispered back “Are you suurre??” I’ll be walking straight into Trumplandia and the Greek tragedy that is my family.\\n\\nUpdate: Here’s a real treat. After you guys so bolstered my confidence and offered support past 24 hrs, I woke up to a text and youtube from my oldest brother (on same group chain about funeral) “proving” that the “Dem Army” [??] is going around shooting cops in the head because “woke” corporations are funding BLM who I guess are using the money like a mafia to murder the innocent. I can take lizard people and Canadian royalty in RVs all day long, but the racist stuff ugh. Best part? Our mom was a bilingual Mexican/navajo who lived in poverty as a child.\\n\\n8/21 Funeral Update: After a LOT of soul-searching I decided to go to funeral. The “wake” will be at the house. Since I have the historical photos, recordings I took of his stories, notes, diplomas, etc I told stepmom I’d make memory video. Not some lame thrown together sad photo montage. We’re a movie industry family. I’m talking a cool if not campy 1950’s “movie short” docu style (upbeat and fun). I make these for the holidays and my Dad loved them. Stepmom wrote back and said “not to put any effort into this” because she decided against it. They married after mom died when he was almost 60. He had this whole ass life before her. Really cool interesting stuff no one seems to know. Obviously I’m still making it and putting on my youtube channel reserved for family history stuff (not just him). I knew something hurtful would happen, I just wasn’t expecting this.   \n",

                Hello, this might sound odd but I have any idea for how to help someone I can see slipping down the rabbit hole and away from their family.  And I’m looking for help.  I know if would take some time on your part but it would mean the world to me, I’m desperate to reach this person.  I’m trying to make this real to her.  This is a lovely women but she’s bought into the Trump savior stuff and is going to lose her kids if she doesn’t take their pleas to give it up seriously.  The conspiracy theories are bad.  It goes from Democrats are pedos, to anti-vax, to covid is an election conspiracy against Trump, and back again.  She hates the Clintons, Kamala, Pelosi, and Joe.  She thinks everyone is out to get Trump and that he is the only one that wants to save America.  \\n\\nEvidence doesn’t seem to do much.  Everything on the Internet seems to blend together.  All articles look the same if you’re information illiterate.\\n\\nSo I’m asking for handwritten letters from kids who have lost their parents to these conspiracies.  Or people who have lost friends.  If you could tell me your stories and how much you miss your family and why you had to cut them off, it would mean the world.  I’m desperate to make these stories seem real.  Please help me.  If you don’t want to, I understand.  I won’t share your letters or names anywhere.  You can use pseudonyms and I can black out your address or tear off your return address when I share them with her but it would mean the world to me if I had some stories about people lost to Q that were not on a digital screen.  Please let me know if you are interested.\\n\\nThank you.   \n",

                                             So I've been trying to talk sense to my mum off and on for the last few years and visit this sub often to get/give advice and I think I may be having a breakthrough. She's not super hardcore fundamentals but pretty close. She actually was poking fun of the fact her elders used to think everything was satanic which I found a bit ironic since she thinks being gay is a sin and a result of demonic influence or something. She thinks Jan 6th was a trick by the Democrats and stuff like that.\\n\\nI've mostly just suggested movies with subtle political messages but they didn't seem to do much until we watched a new animated kids movie on Netflix called \"Nimona\". This movie worked well for me as one of the main characters, Ballister, was a young male like me. It's about a shape shifter who works as an allergory for genderfluid identity or even just trans and non-binary as well. This movie was perfect and I related so much to one of the main characters. It felt like a movie where if you're a conservative parent, there's no escaping the absurdity of the beliefs they hold but it does it in a fairly gentle way as to prevent them from putting their guard down.\\n\\nThis movie ruled and looking into it's production is funny because Disney dropped it. You're results may vary but yeah she's seemed to understand where I'm coming from now and is stepping through a mirror. \\n\\nI feel kinda bad because all I wanted was her to change but now it just feels weird. Like I've made her feel really dumb but honestly I don't care that much because this stuff is too freaky to let slide. GL everyone! ❣️   \n",

rant or asking for advice. A couple weeks ago I found out that my mom purchased black market ivermectin from India. I also heard her talking to the local agriculture store asking if they had ivermectin and our horses have already been recently dewormed this year. My sister and I have talked to her and explained that they could put anything in the drugs from India because it’s not FDA regulated and the dosage for horse ivermectin is well…..for horses. She then belittled us and called us ridiculous saying that ivermectin is curing COVID. She got vaccinated at the beginning of the year but I has fallen into anti-vax propaganda . So she’s not getting the booster. My mom is a nurse and I can’t believe she’s fallen for this. I’m afraid that she’s going to catch COVID, take ivermectin, and I’m going to find her dead from poisoning herself or any other complications. I’ve heard too many stories about people dying from overdosing on ivermectin. Has anyone else had this situation with their Qpeople? How did you talk to them? Thank you.   \n",

Then she’ll randomly spew out Q theories- “the government needs to pay for what they did to us with the vaccine.” “It infuriates me that Kamala has really been running the country the past 4 years while they used Biden as a puppet - that’s practically elder abuse.” and so on. Maybe it sounds like I’m in denial, but across the board she’s pretty moderate with her views and I wouldn’t call her extreme by any means. But she’ll just latch on to these random conspiracies…. Is this the beginning? What’s going on?   \n",

rule. We had to make that rule in the first place because we had a falling out a few years ago when I posted a meme making fun of Trump on my Facebook story. That was out of character for me, while she constantly posted making fun of democrats or calling them all evil and pedophiles. She saw my story and completely went off on me, eventually escalating to making hurtful personal attacks. I finally told her I was done with her and blocked her. \\n\\nShe apologized 9 months later and I forgave her, with the condition that we will not talk politics with each other. \\n\\nI respect this rule. She does not. She has always made comments here and there but it has been a lot worse lately. I always side step her comments, don’t react and let it go to keep the peace. \\n\\nI am so sick of her talking about not being able to support her kids if Kamala gets elected, or how Kamala is going to take all the guns, or how the illegals get all the free handouts she doesn’t get as a single mom. \\n\\nWe recently went out for a nice day at the winery. On the way there, she was saying how a lifelong Democrat warned people not to vote Democrat this election and how dangerous that would be. I didn’t mention the republicans who have endorsed Kamala Harris. I just let it go. On the way home, she talked about how Tim Walz signed a bill making it okay for the state to take custody of children away and transition them against their parent’s wishes. Not true, but I let it go. \\n\\nI’m also sick of her always making it seem like her opinion is fact and the democrats are just too stupid or blind to see it. \\n\\nWhen I said I don’t believe that all of Hollywood is a secret pedophile ring that drinks babies blood for adrenochrome to stay young, she told me it’s absolutely fact but “some people just can’t wrap their heads around it and that’s okay.” \\n\\nJust recently, I expressed some anxiety about our friendship potentially having trouble with the tensions being so high before the election. She said we will be fine and don’t need to talk about it. Then immediately said “I will say this though, we are about to become a third world country if people don’t get their heads out of their asses. But I won’t argue with people about it.” I assume she’s referring to everyone who is not voting Trump having their heads in their asses, therefore talking about me. \\n\\nI am over it. So this morning, I snapped. I didn’t personally attack her, but I was definitely not nice and told her I never do that to her and that I am sick of hearing it.\\n\\nWe have not spoken since. I plan to reach out and talk at some point but I don’t know what to say. I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t know how to repair it or if I want to. I thought it would feel a lot better to tell her off about it, but I just feel sad. I don’t know why they can’t just not talk about it.    \n",

Both my parents have college degrees and are less than 50 years old. My mom raised me and my six younger siblings in the midwest US while my dad worked and ended up having a lucrative career. She homeschooled my siblings and I for a portion of time (early elementary to early middle school for me until I started going to public school again). I was never a stranger to hearing Rush Limbaugh on the radio, going to a John McCain rally on my 8th birthday instead of getting a small birthday party that I had begged for months in advance, hearing that evolution and climate change aren't real, etc., etc. It just got worse and worse as time went on but because she was my mom, who is the adult and knows best, I just went along with it. \\n\\n  \\nMy high school was definitely liberal-leaning, but because of my upbringing and a couple of people I was friends with, it was fun to troll the super left-leaning kids and talk about Trump winning the 2016 election and stuff like that. I regret all of it and towards the end of high school, started to come around a little bit.\\n\\n  \\nI ended up going to a large university where I was (thankfully) around a lot more progressive people who weren't batsh\\*t crazy. A couple of my closest friends listened to me talk about things and opened up my mind to what life is like outside of crazy conspiracy theories and seeing things from a different viewpoint. I ended up becoming pretty passionate about politics and it sent me strongly in the other direction that I had been in for such a long time. \\n\\n  \\nCovid hit and threw a wrench in my freshman-year university experience. I was forced to go back home and be around my family and realized my mom was starting to lose it. Background for her - she comes from a pretty similar situation where her dad worked a long, hard job but was successful and had a large family. However, he was extremely abusive and always said terrible things to my mom, physically hurt her and my uncles, and eventually drove her out of the house. We eventually cut off contact with them, but I know it has affected her more than she is willing to admit. My parents were strict but not abusive and tried to create a loving home, which I will say they did a great job of. I have been close with my siblings all my life.\\n\\nDuring spring 2020, she was always talking about how COVID isn't that bad, how masks don't work, blah blah blah. The vaccine was developed and even though Trump said it is ok and people should get it, she wouldn't budge. She would constantly send conspiracy theory articles in our family group chat and I started challenging them eventually. One time, she sent out a Fox News-like Article with a title along the lines of \"Plane crashes into chicken farm - foreign countries targeting US food supplies?\" and a list of multiple incidents, specifically fires, that were destroying farms and thus the food in the US. I stayed up all night and wrote a paper criticizing her with legitimate sources, not the one she used. I wish I could find it now, but there were literally adult ads with graphic images on the website - only legitimate sources would have those, right? She was ANGRY the next day and didn't talk to me for two days (would ignore me in the house) until my dad came to me. He said she was so upset that I would attack her and asked me to apologize. Eventually, I did. The person who used to get mad at me for using Wikipedia as a source now quotes websites like \"childrenshealthdefense.net\" with p\\*rn ads all over them as gospel. And I'm the bad guy for calling her out. \\n\\nI love my dad but he's part of the problem at this point. He lets her say whatever she wants and when her feelings get hurt, he asks me to make the peace. I do lash out a little bit and try not to insult her, but I did a couple of times. I haven't done that since late 2021 and just gave up fighting back. I worry about my siblings being brainwashed by her because I definitely was, and already I can see it when my fourteen-year-old brother reposts Trump pics on his Instagram account. At the end of the day, he's going to make his own decisions but it's just so stupid. \\n\\nAnother crazy thing - on January 6th, 2021, the day of the incidents at the capital in DC, I was planning on driving to my college town to break up with my girlfriend at the time and spend some time with friends. In my college town. In the center of the Midwest. My mom said \"Just be careful, I think some things are going to go down today\" as I left. Looking back, I've been wondering if she was in some Telegram or other communication platform chats that involved Jan. 6th personnel who stated what they were going to do. She knew in advance, 100%. Why else would she have said that? She believes the election was stolen, people are constantly out to kill Trump, that he is going to shine a light on the world order that truly runs the world, blah blah blah blah blah blah. \\n\\nI'm a couple of years out of college now and don't know what to do. I moved across the country and am living with a woman I plan to marry one day, but she is the opposite of my mother, and very turned off by her. She has stated multiple times, and I agree, that our potential future kids will not be around their grandparents if they continue their behavior. It goes against what I have always wanted, but I just don't want them to be around them like this. My girlfriend's parents are also nuts in a different way, so she's been able to empathize, and we may end up having no grandparents involved one day. \\n\\nOther stuff has happened too, there were some medical and legal power of attorney documents that my parents wanted me to sign before I moved away. For context, they had wanted me to sign them since 2020 but scrambled to get their ducks in a row and finalize the documents once they knew I was moving. I understand their viewpoint but disagree with them having a final say on what happens to me over a doctor with years of medical experience. My girlfriend thought it was a jab at her, which I understand. The POA situation may be a different issue, but I expressed my concerns with it and my mom flipped out. My dad asked me to please just sign it and I could go back and do whatever I wanted later. He knows she is in a \"delicate place\", (literally his words) and is just trying to keep things going smoothly. Because of him, I am also an avoidant person who just tries to smile and make everyone happy, but I don't really want to do that anymore. \\n\\n  \\nAt this point, I am at my wit's end. I am so fed up with seeing crazy headlines or brainless texts in my family group chat that I just ignore (it is very rare that anyone responds, it's just my mom spewing endlessly without a response), and don't know what to do anymore. I don't want it to affect my relationship now, and my girlfriend feels uncomfortable being around my family knowing what they stand for and what things they say and believe. It's embarrassing to have a parent with Trump flags in the house who made me never want to invite friends over and who made me become the laughingstock of my friend group because of her tinfoil hat political beliefs. I don't think it's worth fighting her over it, I don't really enjoy being around her anymore but I do like being around my siblings and my dad. My dad doesn't even fight her on it anymore, as far as I know, and nothing has changed in the last four years. If anything, it's just gotten worse. She doesn't believe in treating mental health (which was fun to deal with when I almost hurt myself and knew she would have opinions about me seeing a therapist) so I know that's off the table. I don't fight her anymore or argue, I just kind of smile and nod Madagascar penguin style. We text every few days and call like once a week, and it's hard to cut off contact with my literal mom. \\n\\nI work remotely in a new state that I moved to less than four months ago and haven't made many new friends. I am definitely at a low point and this situation is definitely not helping. \\n\\nAm I doomed for eternity or is there anything worth trying?   \n",

beautiful music over the years. I decided to check out their webpage, which at first just looks like a regular blog, with lovely pictures of their homestead.\\n\\nThen I started reading the posts. Within the first three pages, I ran into rage-filled rants on the Great Reset, chemtrails, weather control, the evils of vaccines and the \"sheeple\" who take them, the New World Order, how they stopped touring because the pagan music industry is demonic, transphobia, and then charged right into the \"Cabal\" and \"Jewish-run media\". The language was aggressive and hateful, calling everyone \"sheeple\".\\n\\nI guess I always think of the people in the Q and Q-adjacent groups as always being American, fundamentalist Christians of many flavors, right wing, straight laced, etc. \\n\\nThese guys are European, tattooed, dreadlocked, nature-worshipping, things the other Q's would absolutely lose their mind over - but they're both spouting the same poison.\\n\\nI know this isn't as bad as the issues the people have with family and friends deep into this nonsense. But I thoroughly enjoyed their music, it always lifted my mood when I was depressed, and it sickened me to learn what they believe. I don't know if I can ever listen to their stuff again.   \n",

place for this, but seeing as how many of the posts here talk about losing loved ones to conspiracy theories, i think it may be appropriate.\\n\\nMy mother, grandfather and many friends and acquaintances have all been, for lack of a better word, possessed by this conspiracy mind virus that has been going on. I'm not from the US, but i find many similar elements of the QAnon conspiracy spreading even here.\\n\\n\"Bill Gates and the satanic elite have created the coronavirus as an excuse to chip us all so that we can be mind controlled  by the 5G network! Oh and they're all blood drinking pedophiles hell-bent on putting placentas and aborted foetuses into LITERALLY EVERYTHING\"\\n\\nThis is only a slight exaggeration, but only a slight one, as anyone who has spent an extended amount of time speaking to these people can attest.\\n\\nThat isn't to say that every conspiracy theory is necessarily false, just look at MK Ultra. Though there's a slight leap i believe between \"the government is doing shady shit and \"there's a cabal of satanists trying to murder the planet, who may or may not be lizard people (read: jews)\"\\n\\nTrying to shoot down the many.. many obviously false and ludicrous claims has drained a lot of my energy, and quite frankly a good chunk of my sanity too. Why? Well, here's an example:\\n\\nEarly on in the pandemic there were images and stories floating around of a green canister with \"COVID-19\" photoshopped on it. If i remember correctly the image itself was older than the pandemic by quite a lot, besides the fact that it was painfully obvious that the text was added digitally. \\nWell, not obvious enough apparently as it spread through social media of many different countries.\\n\\nOr how about that \"5G tower motherboard with COVID19 printed on it\", that was actually taken from an old VCR? Like you could look it up by a code printed on the board and see where it came from.\\n\\nThis wasn't just random misinterpretation of information that just became viral, this was purposeful disinformation put out there to feed into this growing lunacy. Why? Is it 4chan just pulling shit to mess with people to get a laugh? It's either that, or there's a conspiracy to spread conspiracies around to put the masses into panic mode so that no one gets vaccinated and we all DIE or the global economic system collapses and the lizard people can finally take over the world and drink baby blood out of capri sun packages!\\n\\nYou see what this shit is doing to me? I'm not actually serious about the second part of what i wrote but goddamn does the madness spread. And there's nothing you can do about it.\\nIt has become like a religion, and your belief in the conspiracy is the only way you can reach salvation and therefore those caught in this madness believe it's their moral duty to convince you that it's true so that you don't get microchipped by Microsoft!\\n\\nWho the fuck keeps spreading these lies? Why?! AAAAAGH!\\n\\nAnyway, sorry this rant got so long and thanks for reading. I'm just extremely frustrated by what is happening.   \n",

20 years and for the first we were ok. Pre-2016 he was hippie-conservative - into bikes, western dance, Ren faires, camping, hiking, making stuff, collecting, guns, zombie TV, and libertarian politics. He was loud and a egotist who butted into everything. \\n\\nA classic loud Boomer. Made my 26-13 year old young family feel very unhappy with his ranting about gays, trans, and immigrants. They could hardly stay for holidays.\\n\\nThen from 2016 he went total Q and she followed along. Their senior friend group destabilized as everyone ran off to prep for the apocalypse. And then COVID hit and drove them deeper in.  \\n\\nHe ff'd up so many warehouse jobs shooting off his mouth he decided the city was out to get him. They sold their house by the grandkids and started RV living. And we lost them - wandering TX due to OK being \"too.liberal\" :/ \\n\\nApparently he then lost them multiple jobs in TX due to being a Q asshole and alienating Parks Service admin and guests as a host. \\n\\nMeanwhile, mom, 75 is trying to find a job to make up the difference. She's in great shape, but is into quack and natural cures, thinks big medicine is hiding knowledge because Cayenne pepper is a magic cure, and pretty much everything about magical metals, cures, herbs, salts, and shady treatments for cancer. That's actually nothing new - but it puts her in the cross hairs of Q algorithms. \\n\\nShe tries a job for 2wks and quits if she feels she's not being respected enough. (But unfortunately can't operate computers/phones very well anymore)\\n\\nLong story short - he yeeted her because she wasn't respecting him and correcting him, plus not enough kinky sex. (Remember she's 75, but looks about 55-65, but still.)\\n\\nI'm slowly deprogramming her now since she moved in with me into my new home\\nI ask questions.\\n\\n Just questions and empathize two things \"You are very smart and lived through a lot, why would you still believe something that's been prove untrue after 70 years of experiencing it never being true or happening?\"\\n\\nAnd \\n\\n\"Have you ever seen this happen in reality? Have you ever had someone you know irl tell you it happened right in front of them irl?\"\\n\\nI checked her phone - 100s of open tabs. I removed Fox News and told her the AP was corrupted. I showed her how to use her Drive and Office 365 (which of course her computer subbed her to.)\\n\\nThe worst part - she thought she HAD to give him 50 percent of her tiny savings in a divorce. So she preemptively did that. He spent it on his pepper compound and needed more. So he pretended maybe they get back together.\\n\\nSo she went into reverie. And I pushed it because I told her - if she moved in he could never come here or stay here. And I told her I wasn't comfortable for applying for a job in my center where I would be her direct supervisor. (Just because she tells everyone my personal business. No filter. And outright hates on Black people whom I work with a lot.)\\n\\nAnd so 5 months passed. He nearly killed her once passively - like clearing brush on the coldest day of the year. She started getting chest pains then drove herself 60 miles to the hospital /not wanting him to think she was weak. Hypothermia.  \\n\\nSo final blow - he took her out for a event and later ******* and SA her. And she immediately called me and asked to come.\\n\\nIt didn't have to be this way. But boomer gen has a lot of untreated trauma and mental illness. The constructs of the nuclear couple create fears and shame - from unplanned pregnancy to \"dying alone.\"\\n\\nWhat I said \"You are not dying alone if you live with family. You might not have a man, but it sounds like you don't really want a man, you want a friend or friends. Women in our family usually outlive our men by 25 years or more. So in the end you would be with family.\"\\n\\n(Truth is - if she would have stayed with him she would have ended up caring for him and his death thores from untreated cancer and outlived him while being abused financially and physically while living in a 1 room prepper shack far from medical care.)\\n   \n",

yrs ago, I cut contact to my father who drowned in desinformation, right wing extremism (a certain group in Germany that believes we still live in the German Reich), spritualism and denying every ounce of reality. Nowadays also crossing with Q who are present in Germany as well. He is alarmist, promising the world to collapse evey other day.\\n\\n2 weeks ago, I broke my silence to inform him that his father / my grandfather died. I was always afraid of this moment. Would he try to come back? How deep would he still be into it? Turns out: very deep. Today, he sent me an email that sounds just like - and more extreme - than 10yrs ago. I'm now in my 30s, he is in his 50s. I have no idea how this will end. \\n\\nMy heart goes out to everyone, who is now living through these experiences. \\n\\nIf I learned one thing over the years: take care of yourself, try to work this out - don't surppress that you're hurt. Talk to friends, look for a therapist or helplines focussing on addiction/cults. You are not alone with it and it's not shameful.\\n\\nAnd if you're someones daughter or son: This is mental abuse. It's not your fault. Try to live your life instead and become the person you want to be.\\n\\nIt won't stop hurting, but it will hurt less.   \n",

relatives understand the nature of the Q phenomenon, especially just how dangerous and collective it really is. I want to convince them that our shared Qperson is in danger of being taken advantage of by other Qult members and grifters, not to mention the potential for mental breakdown if/when they see their reality start to crack up. \\n\\nMost normies in my family react when I raise alarm by saying it's probably just silly nonsense that will blow over after Biden gets in office. I hope they're right, but I just want them to understand the potential gravity of this. I don't think they would respond to the QAA guys and their long form episodes. They need to be bluepilled with something more concise and not so overtly leftist.\\n\\n(side note: much love to my QAA boys, keep it up. Especially the walking tragedy that is Jake Rockatansky)   \n",

    "* **Persona 4 (Conservative Identity Protector)** shows the strongest and most consistent emotional associations, significantly increases **anger** and **disgust** --> hostile and aggressive, adopted extreme ideologies that are especially repulsive to their loved ones.\n",
    "* **Persona 5 (Pandemic-Triggered Skeptic)** predominantly induce **fear** and **disgust** --> makes family members genuinely afraid, threatened and infuriated\n",
