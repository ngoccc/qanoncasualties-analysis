I think it may be a hospital thing because like I said he had cancer and was a preteen when he got it. Cancer in general is never good, but I feel like it is worse when you're a kid.\n",

      "So the vaccine will make you infertile and then will spread by air I guess to other unvaccinated people around you. Why does my MIL care? No idea she's not having any more kids. I am not really planning on birthing any kids. Also the FDA apparently never approved any vaccines, but someone approved them to be used for emergencies. So they are only safe if it is an emergency, any other time it is not safe. Who declares it an emergency? I feel like Biden has but they don't listen to a thing he says.\n",

But my MIL has her qanon reasons to hate the vaccine. My boyfriend doesn't know because I just don't want to tell him. I am at that point where I have realized we want different things in life but have been together for over 2 years so it is very hard to let go so I haven't yet. It never feels like a good time to do it and I do truly love him, and I know people reading this will get a different impression because I only wanted to share the MIL bits but I just need to rant. I feel most people on this subreddit understand it's not easy to just ‘let go’ like people always comment. Please don't comment that I need to leave him or anything else. I am working through my emotions because I know it is going to happen someday, not specifically because of the vaccine or his mom, I think we just want different things in life but are too afraid to let go for a multitude of reasons I won't get into.\n",

      "It’s obviously not a secret social media is a major culprit in brainwashing people. I know talk shows like Hannity and Tucker or Faux News or OAN fuel the fire. And soulless politicians with an agenda spread propaganda like wildfire. But my dad has watched/listened to those shows for years yet always stayed pretty level headed. But soon after him and all of his buddies got Facebook, shit started going downhill fast.\n",

      "Flat out, a huge majority of boomers/silent gens (and many younger people in any generation for that matter) never developed the type of critical thinking skills needed to safely navigate the internet. There’s a reason why so many boomers and seniors are so far behind with their technological knowledge despite having been on the forefront of the Information Age. And why they’re the biggest targets for digital scammers. As a whole, too many of the “Leave it to Beaver” generation have the naivety of toddlers when it comes to internet competency.\n",

      "When they grew up, the information they received could largely be trusted. Newspapers and newscasters prided themselves on remaining neutral and factual. They didn’t have 24/7 access to people, so the media had to use their limited space in newspapers or hour of TV/radio air time to get out only the most important, truthful facts. \n",

      "It’s not fully their faults. For most of their lives, older adults never had to worry about vetting information at all. If it was delivered as “news”, then it was probably trustworthy.

      "Now these people are getting bombarded not just from media outlets, but by an endless feed of algorithmically curated content that plays into those media-driven fears. They are deep in an echo chamber they don’t really understand. They don’t know how Facebook algorithms work, or how the platforms can manipulate them, how easy it is to make a bs video look legit, or what an internet troll is.\n",

This is a long introduction, I share this for support but also for any possible hope that my friend will return, even though my hope is pretty much lost. To the moderators, I tried to write this as civil as possible in accordance to the rules, but as I did do some uncivil things towards my friend, I vaguely try to describe them to get the idea across when important to my fight, to show I did say things I shouldn't have, though it escalated beyond what I would have ever thought my childhood friend would become.

Countless sleepovers as kids, late nights of video games. When we got older into highschool and college age, we would discuss politics more. He actually use to be much more liberal than I was, I would parrot things my mother and father said and didn't really form views of my own at that point (highschool age, not college age).

I was the second child and never really felt a connection to church, even when I was parroting what my parents said. It always felt like stories to me, the bible stories felt as real as the stories from cartoons or movies, in that I couldn't imagine it being real. Still, I didn't know anything else. Growing up I was told people that don't believe in god just hate him, and are angry at him. They \"want to think they're smarter and don't want to admit there is someone above them.\" With the strong evangelical Christianity also came strong political stances. Homophobic slurs were and still are used by my family. When I finally came to terms with the fact I was gay, I tried to kill myself, no one in my family to this day knows that I attempted my life. The consensus in my family is the (homophobic slur) are going to burn in hell, and even accepting them is to denounce God. We moved churches when I was in middle school when my family, who were high up in that church were finally told the church wouldn't ban the Gay person from joining the service if they want to hear about God. My family believed that to allow them into the building was a sin. So, the chances are null of coming out to an accepting family. And currently as I go for my Masters, I live with my parents, so cutting them out of the picture is not an option.\n",

      "When I was 19 or so I told A I was gay. He was surprised, but not shocked. He knew I was socially awkward and that's why I didn't have that many friends. He told me he wondered as I never had a girlfriend or showed interest in perusing girls, no prom, but said he also thought it could have just been my shyness. I felt comfortable telling him because of his political views. At that point I was beginning to think for myself instead of my parents telling me how to think, and grew much more liberal within the first year of college, undoing the brainwashing. This is the first major thing I bring up, because I know about strong brainwashing, I grew up with it, but I found a way out. I wonder if that is possible for my friend. Sadly the flipside to that hypothesis is I hadn't really had my own views before, and I also had a big reason to change, as I accepted my sexuality, more dominos began to fall. For me it was almost inevitable when I was out from under my parents brain washing, I had something that would pull my views in a more liberal direction, being LGBTQ+. I joined groups and made a few friends that were LGBTQ+. The point being, the reason I felt comfortable coming out to A was because he was very liberal and openly accepting of gay people. It was nice to have someone I could trust, nice that my friend I've had since a kid was accepting, that is until the run up of the 2016 election.\n",

I really wanted Bernie to be president, but knew above all else Trump couldn't be, and was more than willing to go with Hillary, sure she didn't push as many of the issues I wanted done, but she was better than Trump. But A didn't feel that way. It was really weird, when Bernie lost the Primary something changed. I had never heard him use the word \"Cunt\" before, but that would always come into play when talking about Hillary. He was convinced she rigged it to destroy Bernie. And to my shock, he suddenly became a Trump supporter. I would roll my eyes, knowing he'd never get elected and that this would be over with after the election. But it was only getting started.\n",

      "As more and more came out about Trump, he would seek out anything negative he could against Hillary. The issue was, he agreed with basically all of her views. So where some people could use the excuse of abortion, he was for abortion. He was for everything she stood for, and AGAINST the things trump was for. So he began to try to justify Trump. At the time, I thought he was trying to justify Trump to me, knowing I agreed with the things Hillary stood for, he would try to find other reasons. But retrospectively, I think he was justifying Trump to himself. He got heavily invested in the Pizzagate stuff. He would send me chan board links about proof that she was running a child sex ring out of that pizza place. No matter what I did to try to counter his arguments, he dug his heels in deeper.\n",

But as I feared for the progress we as a country had made in LGBTQ+ acceptance, there was a bit of hope that A would see just how much of a disaster Trump was and finally drop this. And once again, I was horribly wrong. As Trump trampled the constitution and laws of the country, any time I would point out illegality or horrible policy he was set with \"Well, Hillary would have been worse.\" He became convinced that Hillary was going to start world war 3 with Iran and Russia.

I don't remember the first time he mentioned Q, I don't think I even knew what that was back then. But when Covid hit, he was non stop about how it's a hoax meant to hurt trump. How wearing masks is dangerous. As it was clear people were dying from this \"hoax\", he pivoted to it's real, but it was a ploy between Hillary, Obama, and China to hurt Trump. I stayed away for the year because I wasn't going to risk my health since he was refusing to wear a mask. OAN began to be his go to news source. Reddit became to him more \"Liberal propaganda\". Big Tech was apparently working together to push this covid thing to hurt trump, but he was confident that Trump would win. I would point to polls, he would say how the liberals said the same about Hillary. And I'll be honest, I was terrified of Trump winning. That was a stressful few days.\n",

He believed that Trump actually won, believed this was going to be when the military's would round up Hillary and the democrat pedophiles. During the January 6th insurrection, he sent me the manifesto codemonkey released about Pence trying to steal the presidency. As the insurrection started he texted me about \"It's Happening!\" And the whole \"History is being made\" thing. I've seen those tweets of someone else saying that and actually grew curious, since he almost verbatim texted me that, if this was some \"text all the people you know\" boomer sort of activism you'd see at the end of God's Not Dead movies.\n",

Sorry, it just frustrates me to no end. It's been the same since then. I've asked where he gets his news, and he said OAN and GreatAwakening dot win. He and I have argued a lot, as I became more aware of the Q stuff I would try to trap him in a corner, I felt like if I could make him see it's fake, my friend would still be in there. I've always been able to hold my own in a political argument. I argue with my family all the time, and while they aren't Q believers thankfully, they still are very alt-right in their views. I know how to pick apart an OAN bad faith argument. \"You do know the kkk was made by the democrats, right?\" As if A thinks that's some sort of gotcha on me, I would just reply \"But who does the kkk support today and what parties views align with that of the kkk?\"\n",

      "It's to a point where I'm a very informed, educated debater that is sound in my views, and he is a pressuring Q believer who thought he could tango with me. But we got into a big fight recently, and he threatened something too far. I did say things that were mean, but I don't regret, it was a fight. I mocked him about adrenochrome and how my 5g has gotten so much better since getting the vaccine. But things turned ugly. I mocked Q, told him I thought he was smart but he was duped by the guy who runs a forum for white supremacists and horror. I don't think he knew about the HBO documentary. After the documentary, I really began to investigate and become informed, as I felt like if I could counter his arguments, and shatter some of the illusions, maybe my friend would still be there. And once again, I was wrong. Up until this point I think he thought I was just uninformed, that he could convince me. He kept telling me about dates when big things would happen. But when I began to mock 8chan, ask questions he couldn't answer like why Q would not just move to a different website when 8chan was down. When I kept coming back to codemonkey being Q, and I said something mean about how he was tricked by a troll and wasted years of his life waiting for something to happen that was never going to happen. (I'm not saying exactly what I said, but I admit I was mean, I said things that would violate the rules so I'm being vague, but I admit fully I was mad and angry and said cruel things, mocking his intelligence and stuff) He came back to me with \"What would your parents think?\" I thought he thought they either believed in Q or they didn't know I was a liberal.

They wouldn't let me live in their home anymore. They would disown me. I now live in fear of that text. A \"I can't win this argument, but I can make you submit\" card. I haven't argued about anything he's sent me about Q since then. I have asked if he is sorry he threatened me with outing me, and he said it wasn't a threat, it was a question, and that he is not sorry and that he is \"done with me harassing him about Q\" as if he isn't the one constantly sending me stuff when I have begged to stop the politics.\n",

Even when they use slurs, my older brother not just a bigot to gay people, but towards other races too, even then I've known them my whole life and I don't want to lose them, I've already lost enough.

These sorts of views propagated throughout the rest of his political ideology, things about how cars aren't environmentally unfriendly, how woke people are a problem, etc. I disagree to a very large extent with almost all of these opinions, but generally I'm okay to just say \"Agree to disagree\", especially given that he's my father, and he's not someone I can just replace after a falling out in my life.\n",
